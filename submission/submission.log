Answer:

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:43:46.457 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO (Carbon Monoxide) in the year 2022, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators such as "Intensity ratio" and "Carbon emission per m2 of office space."

Neither of these indicators directly provides information on the air emissions of CO in the year 2022. The "Intensity ratio" and "Carbon emission per m2 of office space" do not specifically mention CO emissions or provide data on CO emissions for the year 2022.

Without a specific indicator related to CO emissions or air emissions of pollutants in the table, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO in the year 2022 from the given context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2022?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:43:47.424 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO specifically in the year 2022, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2)" and "Scope 1."

The "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2)" indicator provides information on the total carbon emissions in tonnes of CO2, which is different from specifically measuring CO emissions. CO2 and CO are different pollutants, with CO2 being carbon dioxide and CO being carbon monoxide. Therefore, the information provided in the table does not directly give the air emissions of CO in the year 2022.

Since the table does not contain a specific indicator for CO emissions, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2022?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:43:57.254 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO specifically for the year 2022, we need to look for the relevant data in the provided markdown table. The table includes information on Scope 1 emissions for stationary and mobile diesel combustion, but it does not provide a specific value for CO emissions in the year 2022.

The table only mentions the emissions in metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent for stationary diesel combustion and mobile diesel combustion. It does not directly provide the emissions of CO for the year 2022. CO2 and CO are different pollutants, and the table does not break down the emissions by individual pollutants.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2022?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:44:22.845 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, there is information about the registered office of Impala Bafokeng, the company secretary's contact email, and the auditors (Deloitte & Touche). However, there is no specific mention of advisory fees or an income statement in the table. The table primarily provides contact information and details about the company's office location, company secretary, and auditors.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:44:25.497 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO in the year 2023, we need to look for a specific value related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on "Group total" and "Total indirect CO2" for the year 2023. There is no specific mention of CO emissions in the table for the year 2023.

Since there is no direct mention of CO emissions in the table for the year 2023, we cannot determine the specific air emissions of CO for that year based on the information provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of CO in the year 2023?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:44:26.275 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To determine the air emissions of CO specifically for the year 2023, we need to look for a row or entry in the table that directly provides this information. In the provided markdown table, there is a row labeled "Total indirect CO2," which indicates the total indirect CO2 emissions. However, this row does not specify the emissions of CO (carbon monoxide) specifically.

The table only provides data for "Total indirect CO2" emissions for Impala Rustenburg for the years 2019 to 2023. Since the table does not contain a specific entry for CO emissions, we cannot directly retrieve the information on the CO emissions for the year 2023 from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2023?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:44:52.394 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO in the year 2023, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators related to GHG emissions intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, expressed as metric tonnes of CO2e per unit of Million Rands. However, these indicators do not provide the direct amount of CO emissions in metric tonnes for the year 2023.

The indicators in the table focus on GHG emissions intensity for different scopes and are expressed in CO2e, which includes various greenhouse gases, not just CO. Without a specific breakdown of CO emissions in metric tonnes for the year 2023, we cannot determine the exact amount of CO emissions from the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of CO in the year 2023?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:44:52.919 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO (Carbon Monoxide) in the year 2023, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "159 Carbon Emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 3" and "160 Total Carbon Emissions (tonnes CO2e)." However, these indicators specifically mention CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent) emissions, not CO emissions.

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a different pollutant from Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and the table does not provide a specific value for CO emissions. Without a direct mention of CO emissions in the table, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO in the year 2023 from the given data.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2023?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-14 22:45:08.584 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO in the year 2023, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information about GHG emissions in terms of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) for indirect scope 2 and indirect scope 3.

The table does not provide specific data on the emissions of CO (carbon monoxide) for the year 2023. It only presents information on CO2e emissions for different scopes. Since CO and CO2 are different pollutants, we cannot directly retrieve the air emissions of CO from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2023?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:45:09.067 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO (carbon monoxide) in the year 2023, we need to look for a specific indicator related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent.

The table does not provide specific data on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. It mentions indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent, but these are different from carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.

Since the table does not contain information on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions specifically, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO in the year 2023 from the given data.

Answer:

2024-03-14 22:45:59.275 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:300 - Filtering context response: To find the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to advisory fees in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators related to Auditor Remuneration and the length of the current auditor's service.

The indicators in the table do not directly provide information on the Advisory fees as per the income statement. The Auditor Remuneration percentage of non-audit fees and the length of the current auditor's service are not directly related to the specific question about Advisory fees in the income statement for the year 2021.

Without a specific indicator related to Advisory fees in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the information about the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The data provided in the table is for "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" in terms of tCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent). While CO2 is a type of carbon emission, it is not the same as CO (carbon monoxide).
