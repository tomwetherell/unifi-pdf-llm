      "Carbon Management\n",
      "Carbon footprint assessment results can inform where an organisation should focus its reduction efforts, in terms of\n",
      "emission sources and facilities. There are certain parameters that should be taken into account, including:\n",
      "· The relative contribution of an emission source to UCT's overall carbon footprint\n",
      ". The control that UCT has over an emissions-generating activity\n",
      "· Confidence in the existing data and results\n",
      "Scope 2\n",
      "Scope 2 emissions amounted to 58,166 tCO2e which contributed 64% of UCT's most recent greenhouse gas inventory. Of\n",
      "this, 54% are accounted for by electricity consumption on Main Campus. Electricity consumption at Main Campus\n",
      "offers the greatest opportunity for emission reductions within UCT's carbon footprint. Although these are indirect\n",
      "emissions which take place off-site, the consumption of grid electricity at the facilities within the assessment boundary\n",
      "is under UCT's operational control. Although some improvements can be made in terms of clarifying the Scope 2 boundary,\n",
      "data quality and completeness is relatively robust. With the rollout of various solar PV installations on UCT campuses,\n",
      "future inventories will take into account avoided emissions related to the use of renewable energy. If UCT continues on a\n",
      "journey to transition from grid to renewable electricity use, combined with energy efficiency initiatives throughout its\n",
      "campuses for lighting and air conditioning, these avoided emissions will start to displace Scope 2 emissions over time.\n",
      "Scope 1 and 3\n",
      "Although Scope 1 and 3 contribute a smaller portion of UCT's total carbon footprint, there are still opportunities for\n",
      "reducing emissions, as well as reducing the institution's overall environmental impact.\n",
      "· Shuttle and vehicle fleets:\n",
      "UCT should investigate the feasibility of converting UCT's shuttle and vehicle fleets to electric vehicles. This\n",
      "initiative can run alongside the installation of solar electricity production, such that electric vehicles can be\n",
      "charged on-site via solar PV. UCT can also focus on route and driving efficiency to reduce overall fuel\n",
      "consumption.\n",
      "· Fugitive refrigerant gases:\n",
      "UCT should phase out the use of R22 and any other HCFC gases for refrigeration or air-conditioning purposes\n",
      "due to their ozone-depleting qualities. Although they are not ozone-depleting substances, HFCs also have very\n",
      "high global warming potentials, which means that even small gas refills in air-conditioning systems can\n",
      "significantly increase UCT's Scope 1 emissions. Alternative, climate-friendly refrigerant gases should be\n",
      "considered such as hydrocarbons, ammonia or carbon dioxide.\n",

      "Paper use:\n",
      "The majority of paper - 88% in 2020 and 75% in 2021 - is for office use (rather than custodial) and this is\n",
      "where UCT can focus on reducing paper use. Overall the contribution of total paper emissions to UCT's\n",
      "footprint is less than 1%, so these efforts would be in light of the broader environmental impact of paper use,\n",
      "more than its impact on the atmosphere.\n",
      "· Waste generation:\n",
      "78% of UCT's waste is sent to landfill. Although waste emissions only contribute 1.5% of total greenhouse gas\n",

      "possible with the information provided. However, campus-level electricity data does not show exactly which\n",
      "erfs are included. Although a Master Erven and Property Areas lists were provided, it is not entirely clear which\n",
      "of the erfs are covered in the campus-level data, and the erf lists don't completely align. Various facilities were\n",
      "not assigned an area (m2). Ideally UCT will develop a comprehensive list of erf numbers where electricity\n",
      "consumption is under UCT's operational control, and submit consumption data at an erf level. Currently this is\n",
      "being considered as part of a 5-year data management plan by UCT.\n",
      "· Diesel used in generators: Unlike the data provided for UCT's 2019 assessment, diesel consumption data\n",
      "provided for 2020 and 2021 was not disaggregated between buses and Quantums. Emissions associated with\n",
      "one Quantum vehicle was previously reported in the UCT fleet emissions category. It was not possible to report\n",
      "the same way for 2020 and 2021 since data was consolidated by fuel type. Therefore, emissions arising from\n",
      "this vehicle's activity may be double counted. Ideally fuel consumption per vehicle should be collected, to\n",
      "clearly separate shuttle and fleet emissions.\n",
      "· Business Travel: Data was provided in the form of SAP general ledgers, which log information including\n",
      "expenditure. However, no travel distances or routes are logged, and this information is required for\n",
      "greenhouse gas emission calculations. UCT should implement a system for logging all flight routes and flight\n",
      "class for air travel, as well as distances or fuel quantities related to travel by road.\n",
      "· Construction: The data provided for this first assessment of UCT's construction footprint was neatly\n",
      "aggregated as total capital expenditure (capex) on construction-related projects and infrastructure. However,\n",
      "accounting for construction emissions based on expenditure provides a very broad estimate of the actual\n",
      "impact. Since this source contributes a material portion of UCT's greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of Scope\n",
      "3 emissions, improving the quality of this data can help UCT to better understand and manage this source of\n",

      "Carbon Management\n",
      "Carbon footprint assessment results can inform where an organisation should focus its reduction efforts, in terms of\n",
      "emission sources and facilities. There are certain parameters that should be taken into account, including:\n",
      "· The relative contribution of an emission source to UCT's overall carbon footprint\n",
      ". The control that UCT has over an emissions-generating activity\n",
      "· Confidence in the existing data and results\n",
      "Scope 2\n",
      "Scope 2 emissions amounted to 58,166 tCO2e which contributed 64% of UCT's most recent greenhouse gas inventory. Of\n",
      "this, 54% are accounted for by electricity consumption on Main Campus. Electricity consumption at Main Campus\n",
      "offers the greatest opportunity for emission reductions within UCT's carbon footprint. Although these are indirect\n",
      "emissions which take place off-site, the consumption of grid electricity at the facilities within the assessment boundary\n",
      "is under UCT's operational control. Although some improvements can be made in terms of clarifying the Scope 2 boundary,\n",
      "data quality and completeness is relatively robust. With the rollout of various solar PV installations on UCT campuses,\n",
      "future inventories will take into account avoided emissions related to the use of renewable energy. If UCT continues on a\n",
      "journey to transition from grid to renewable electricity use, combined with energy efficiency initiatives throughout its\n",
      "campuses for lighting and air conditioning, these avoided emissions will start to displace Scope 2 emissions over time.\n",
      "Scope 1 and 3\n",
      "Although Scope 1 and 3 contribute a smaller portion of UCT's total carbon footprint, there are still opportunities for\n",
      "reducing emissions, as well as reducing the institution's overall environmental impact.\n",
      "· Shuttle and vehicle fleets:\n",
      "UCT should investigate the feasibility of converting UCT's shuttle and vehicle fleets to electric vehicles. This\n",
      "initiative can run alongside the installation of solar electricity production, such that electric vehicles can be\n",
      "charged on-site via solar PV. UCT can also focus on route and driving efficiency to reduce overall fuel\n",
      "consumption.\n",
      "· Fugitive refrigerant gases:\n",
      "UCT should phase out the use of R22 and any other HCFC gases for refrigeration or air-conditioning purposes\n",
      "due to their ozone-depleting qualities. Although they are not ozone-depleting substances, HFCs also have very\n",
      "high global warming potentials, which means that even small gas refills in air-conditioning systems can\n",
      "significantly increase UCT's Scope 1 emissions. Alternative, climate-friendly refrigerant gases should be\n",
      "considered such as hydrocarbons, ammonia or carbon dioxide.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Paper use:\n",
      "The majority of paper - 88% in 2020 and 75% in 2021 - is for office use (rather than custodial) and this is\n",
      "where UCT can focus on reducing paper use. Overall the contribution of total paper emissions to UCT's\n",
      "footprint is less than 1%, so these efforts would be in light of the broader environmental impact of paper use,\n",
      "more than its impact on the atmosphere.\n",
      "· Waste generation:\n",
      "78% of UCT's waste is sent to landfill. Although waste emissions only contribute 1.5% of total greenhouse gas\n",
      "emissions, the amount of material sent to landfill is contributing to South Africa's overfilled landfill crisis,\n",

      "assessments. Refer to Appendix A - \"Methodology\" for the current system of data management.\n",
      "· Electricity consumption: The boundary of facilities included in this assessment was drawn as accurately as\n",
      "possible with the information provided. However, campus-level electricity data does not show exactly which\n",
      "erfs are included. Although a Master Erven and Property Areas lists were provided, it is not entirely clear which\n",
      "of the erfs are covered in the campus-level data, and the erf lists don't completely align. Various facilities were\n",
      "not assigned an area (m2). Ideally UCT will develop a comprehensive list of erf numbers where electricity\n",
      "consumption is under UCT's operational control, and submit consumption data at an erf level. Currently this is\n",
      "being considered as part of a 5-year data management plan by UCT.\n",
      "· Diesel used in generators: Unlike the data provided for UCT's 2019 assessment, diesel consumption data\n",
      "provided for 2020 and 2021 was not disaggregated between buses and Quantums. Emissions associated with\n",
      "one Quantum vehicle was previously reported in the UCT fleet emissions category. It was not possible to report\n",
      "the same way for 2020 and 2021 since data was consolidated by fuel type. Therefore, emissions arising from\n",
      "this vehicle's activity may be double counted. Ideally fuel consumption per vehicle should be collected, to\n",
      "clearly separate shuttle and fleet emissions.\n",
      "· Business Travel: Data was provided in the form of SAP general ledgers, which log information including\n",
      "expenditure. However, no travel distances or routes are logged, and this information is required for\n",
      "greenhouse gas emission calculations. UCT should implement a system for logging all flight routes and flight\n",
      "class for air travel, as well as distances or fuel quantities related to travel by road.\n",
      "· Construction: The data provided for this first assessment of UCT's construction footprint was neatly\n",
      "aggregated as total capital expenditure (capex) on construction-related projects and infrastructure. However,\n",
      "accounting for construction emissions based on expenditure provides a very broad estimate of the actual\n",
      "impact. Since this source contributes a material portion of UCT's greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of Scope\n",
      "3 emissions, improving the quality of this data can help UCT to better understand and manage this source of\n",
      "emissions in future. Ideally, UCT will collect data that includes the types and quantities (by weight) of materials\n",
      "used for construction, for future assessments.\n",
      "· Food supply: Emission factors are derived from a pertinent UCT-based study that focused on specific catering\n",
      "items at the university. This provides high specificity but the study should be conducted again to obtain more\n",
      "up-to-date results rather than referring to emission factors developed in 2013 which no longer reflect the\n",
      "exact procurement processes currently followed at the institution. UCT should also obtain more accurate\n",
      "information regarding the number of food vendors operating on campus during each financial year. Ideally\n",
      "data will eventually be submitted by all vendors to cover the sale volumes from each.\n",
      "· Commute survey: UCT should conduct a new survey of staff and students to obtain a more updated breakdown\n",
      "of travel to and from campus. The survey can also be expanded to ask additional questions that will further\n",
      "inform emissions estimates.\n",

      "required. Various assumptions were made to reach a best estimate of final consumption values. Assumptions are listed\n",
      "in Appendix B \"Assumptions and Limitations\".\n",

      "Diesel used in generators\n",
      "· Emissions associated with stationary combustion relate to diesel purchased for use in generators to supply\n",
      "energy on site, as well as LPG purchased for use at various locations. Diesel data was provided in the form of\n",
      "fuel purchases, which were converted to estimated litres of diesel combusted, through the application of an\n",

      "found that most fuel prices applied were not accurate. GCX adjusted them to recalculate diesel consumption\n",
      "values, which are also provided on the supplied invoices. Invoices were provided for all 2020 transaction\n",
      "records and for less than half of 2021 transaction records. After adjustments, the total diesel consumption\n",
      "reduced by 15% for 2020 and by 3.5% in 2021. This differs from the 2019 methodology where only the\n",
      "information provided on invoices was utilised and it was noted that not all invoices were available, so total\n",
      "diesel use was under reported. LPG data was supplied by P&S as expenditure information, which included\n",
      "service charges. Since this is not a true reflection of LPG use, PDF invoices were provided, which GCX used to\n",
      "verify the actual quantities of LPG purchased. The PDFs refer to two locations for 2020 and 2021: UCT Ring\n",
      "Road Rondebosch and Medical Campus. UCT confirm that although there were more location categories in the\n",
      "2019 assessment, the information provided is comprehensive for the current reporting years.\n",
      "Fugitive Emissions\n",
      "· Fugitive emissions from refrigerant gases that escaped from air-conditioning systems are reported in Scope 1,\n",
      "except for emissions associated with refills of R22 gas, which is not a Kyoto gas and is reported out of scope.\n",
      "Several different refrigerant gas types were refilled during each reporting period. The relevant emission factor\n",

      "\f24\n",
      "Vehicle Fleet\n",
      "· Vehicle fleet data was provided by Absa, Eqstra and from UCT via the internal SAP system. Previously, data was\n",
      "also provided by Bidvest to facilitate the calculation of a UCT-specific Rands per litre for petrol and fuel\n",
      "consumption. However, since all Bidvest fuel purchases are also logged on the SAP system, UCT chose to\n",
      "utilise the SAP data rather than sourcing the Bidvest report. As such, fleet emission calculations are based on\n",
      "lower quality data this year, because Bidvest activity is included based on expenditure data and the Rands per\n",
      "litre applied to convert all expenditure data from SAP to fuel quantities is based on national average fuel prices\n",
      "for 2020 and 2021.\n",
      "· Quantums - travel emissions are now reported in the Shuttle emissions category rather than Fleet (as in 2019)\n",
      "because fuel consumption data is provided consolidated per fuel type. Since Quantums and buses both use\n",
      "diesel, Quantum activity can't be separated from the UCT Shuttle buses. Eqstra report: several line items\n",
      "reported fuel use, but the fuel type was not noted. In these instances, it is assumed to be petrol. Eqstra report\n",
      "summary does not provide dates to differentiate between 2020 and 2021. Therefore, the litres are split in half\n",
      "between the 2 reporting periods as a best estimate. Most likely, 2020 was lower and 2021 was higher. Although\n",
      "Bidvest information is included in the SAP report, that data was previously excluded from the SAP totals and\n",
      "reported separately, because the travel in these owned vehicles monitored by Bidvest was logged in litres of\n",
      "fuel, which yields more accurate emission calculations. Since actual consumption data is not provided in the\n",
      "SAP report, total spend is used to estimate fuel quantities, applying 45 / 55% split between diesel and petrol\n",
      "assuming a similar split to the ABSA vehicles activity. Cost per km is based on average price of petrol and\n",
      "diesel in each reporting year.\n",
      "UCT Shuttle\n",

      "Therefore, the emissions are reported under UCT Shuttle category. CA 329 930 (Nissan NP200) and CA 311 628\n",
      "(VW Polo) were previously reported with UCT-owned vehicle fleet emissions, rather than shuttle emissions.\n",
      "Since this data is reported separately, due to the different fuel type (petrol) we are able to continue to report\n",
      "the associated emissions with UCT-owned vehicle fleet emissions category. Balance of vehicles: to avoid\n",
      "double counting, all records on SAP report labelled \"Jammie Shuttle\" have been removed and are excluded\n",
      "from the emissions reported in Fleet category. Therefore, it is assumed none of these vehicles' fuel\n",
      "consumption emissions are double counted. One Quantum vehicle: CA 299 702 was reported to be part of the\n",
      "Bidvest-managed fleet in 2019. This vehicle consumes diesel and the associated fuel use was reported\n",

      "Data Management\n",
      "There are good opportunities for UCT to improve data quality and, therefore, the accuracy of emissions results. The next\n",
      "step in improving data quality will be to aim for the collection of consumption or distance data rather than expenditure\n",
      "data. Some emission sources are already reported based on consumption such as diesel use and electricity. However,\n",
      "some are still based on expenditure such as business travel and construction, which requires estimates to convert the\n",
      "data into consumption figures, to enable the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions. UCT can establish internal systems\n",
      "to begin logging consumption or distances travelled, which will enable more accurate calculations going forward.\n",
      "Carbon Management\n",
      "Carbon management strategies should focus on the greatest source of emissions over which UCT has operational control,\n",
      "which is currently the electricity consumption at Main Campus. With the rollout of various solar PV installations on UCT\n",
      "campuses, future inventories will take into account avoided emissions related to the use of renewable energy. If UCT\n",
      "continues on a journey to transition from grid to renewable electricity use, combined with energy efficiency initiatives\n",

      "ad hoc, between March and September 2022. Upon receipt of each data set, GCX reviewed and queried it to ensure it was\n",
      "applicable and comprehensive based on previous years' collections. Some updates were made where necessary. The\n",
      "calculations and methodology were independently reviewed by Carbon Calculated. The following report discusses and\n",

      "Carbon Management\n",
      "Carbon footprint assessment results can inform where an organisation should focus its reduction efforts, in terms of\n",
      "emission sources and facilities. There are certain parameters that should be taken into account, including:\n",
      "· The relative contribution of an emission source to UCT's overall carbon footprint\n",
      ". The control that UCT has over an emissions-generating activity\n",
      "· Confidence in the existing data and results\n",
      "Scope 2\n",
      "Scope 2 emissions amounted to 58,166 tCO2e which contributed 64% of UCT's most recent greenhouse gas inventory. Of\n",
      "this, 54% are accounted for by electricity consumption on Main Campus. Electricity consumption at Main Campus\n",
      "offers the greatest opportunity for emission reductions within UCT's carbon footprint. Although these are indirect\n",
      "emissions which take place off-site, the consumption of grid electricity at the facilities within the assessment boundary\n",
      "is under UCT's operational control. Although some improvements can be made in terms of clarifying the Scope 2 boundary,\n",
      "data quality and completeness is relatively robust. With the rollout of various solar PV installations on UCT campuses,\n",
      "future inventories will take into account avoided emissions related to the use of renewable energy. If UCT continues on a\n",
      "journey to transition from grid to renewable electricity use, combined with energy efficiency initiatives throughout its\n",
      "campuses for lighting and air conditioning, these avoided emissions will start to displace Scope 2 emissions over time.\n",
      "Scope 1 and 3\n",
      "Although Scope 1 and 3 contribute a smaller portion of UCT's total carbon footprint, there are still opportunities for\n",
      "reducing emissions, as well as reducing the institution's overall environmental impact.\n",
      "· Shuttle and vehicle fleets:\n",
      "UCT should investigate the feasibility of converting UCT's shuttle and vehicle fleets to electric vehicles. This\n",
      "initiative can run alongside the installation of solar electricity production, such that electric vehicles can be\n",
      "charged on-site via solar PV. UCT can also focus on route and driving efficiency to reduce overall fuel\n",
      "consumption.\n",
      "· Fugitive refrigerant gases:\n",
      "UCT should phase out the use of R22 and any other HCFC gases for refrigeration or air-conditioning purposes\n",
      "due to their ozone-depleting qualities. Although they are not ozone-depleting substances, HFCs also have very\n",
      "high global warming potentials, which means that even small gas refills in air-conditioning systems can\n",
      "significantly increase UCT's Scope 1 emissions. Alternative, climate-friendly refrigerant gases should be\n",
      "considered such as hydrocarbons, ammonia or carbon dioxide.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Paper use:\n",
      "The majority of paper - 88% in 2020 and 75% in 2021 - is for office use (rather than custodial) and this is\n",
      "where UCT can focus on reducing paper use. Overall the contribution of total paper emissions to UCT's\n",
      "footprint is less than 1%, so these efforts would be in light of the broader environmental impact of paper use,\n",
      "more than its impact on the atmosphere.\n",
      "· Waste generation:\n",
      "78% of UCT's waste is sent to landfill. Although waste emissions only contribute 1.5% of total greenhouse gas\n",
      "emissions, the amount of material sent to landfill is contributing to South Africa's overfilled landfill crisis,\n",

      "· Electricity consumption: The boundary of facilities included in this assessment was drawn as accurately as\n",
      "possible with the information provided. However, campus-level electricity data does not show exactly which\n",
      "erfs are included. Although a Master Erven and Property Areas lists were provided, it is not entirely clear which\n",
      "of the erfs are covered in the campus-level data, and the erf lists don't completely align. Various facilities were\n",
      "not assigned an area (m2). Ideally UCT will develop a comprehensive list of erf numbers where electricity\n",
      "consumption is under UCT's operational control, and submit consumption data at an erf level. Currently this is\n",
      "being considered as part of a 5-year data management plan by UCT.\n",
      "· Diesel used in generators: Unlike the data provided for UCT's 2019 assessment, diesel consumption data\n",
      "provided for 2020 and 2021 was not disaggregated between buses and Quantums. Emissions associated with\n",
      "one Quantum vehicle was previously reported in the UCT fleet emissions category. It was not possible to report\n",
      "the same way for 2020 and 2021 since data was consolidated by fuel type. Therefore, emissions arising from\n",
      "this vehicle's activity may be double counted. Ideally fuel consumption per vehicle should be collected, to\n",
      "clearly separate shuttle and fleet emissions.\n",
      "· Business Travel: Data was provided in the form of SAP general ledgers, which log information including\n",
      "expenditure. However, no travel distances or routes are logged, and this information is required for\n",
      "greenhouse gas emission calculations. UCT should implement a system for logging all flight routes and flight\n",
      "class for air travel, as well as distances or fuel quantities related to travel by road.\n",
      "· Construction: The data provided for this first assessment of UCT's construction footprint was neatly\n",
      "aggregated as total capital expenditure (capex) on construction-related projects and infrastructure. However,\n",
      "accounting for construction emissions based on expenditure provides a very broad estimate of the actual\n",
      "impact. Since this source contributes a material portion of UCT's greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of Scope\n",
      "3 emissions, improving the quality of this data can help UCT to better understand and manage this source of\n",
      "emissions in future. Ideally, UCT will collect data that includes the types and quantities (by weight) of materials\n",
      "used for construction, for future assessments.\n",
      "· Food supply: Emission factors are derived from a pertinent UCT-based study that focused on specific catering\n",
      "items at the university. This provides high specificity but the study should be conducted again to obtain more\n",
      "up-to-date results rather than referring to emission factors developed in 2013 which no longer reflect the\n",
      "exact procurement processes currently followed at the institution. UCT should also obtain more accurate\n",
      "information regarding the number of food vendors operating on campus during each financial year. Ideally\n",
      "data will eventually be submitted by all vendors to cover the sale volumes from each.\n",
      "· Commute survey: UCT should conduct a new survey of staff and students to obtain a more updated breakdown\n",
      "of travel to and from campus. The survey can also be expanded to ask additional questions that will further\n",
