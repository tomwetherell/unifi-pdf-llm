Are you sure that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:38:15.952 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2023, 2022, and 2020 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot confirm that "124.0" is the correct answer for the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '6162.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of employees receiving leadership training in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:38:51.581 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The number of employees receiving leadership training in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for 2020, 2022, and 2023 are given, but there is no specific value for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of employees receiving leadership training in 2021 from this table.

For the second table:

The number of employees receiving leadership training in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 6162. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees receiving leadership training in the year 2021?" based on this table is 6162.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '15800.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE (RSA only) - Black-owned women spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:38:59.670 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we see that the value for "Black-owned women spend" is provided as 15800. This table does not explicitly mention the value for "B-BBEE (RSA only) - Black-owned women spend" for the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we see that there is no specific mention of "Black-owned women spend" for that year. The value provided is for "Black-owned spend" which is 23800.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, we see that the value for "Black-owned women spend" is explicitly stated as 15800.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE (RSA only) - Black-owned women spend in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is 15800.0.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:39:06.971 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for Human Capital, the turnover for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Therefore, we cannot determine the turnover for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for Natural Capital, the turnover per employee for the year 2021 is given as 6.97 Rands million. This value is explicitly provided for the year in question.

Looking at the third table for Human Capital, the turnover for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 3869.

Therefore, the correct turnover value for the year 2021 is 3869 from the third table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '13.2' is the correct answer.

For the second table "Sasol in Society - Spend", the Social Investment Spend - Environment and biodiversity in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '13.2'. Therefore, '13.2' is the correct answer for this table.

For the third table "Natural Capital - Our environment", the Surface area affected by operations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '13.2' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:39:23.006 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of Direct taxes paid to government in 2021 from this table.

For the second table, the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '9509'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021?" is '9509'.

For the third table, the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of Direct taxes paid to government in 2021 from this table.

So, the correct answer is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:39:48.270 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Permanent employees for the year 2021 is listed as 28725.

In the second table, the Permanent employees for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided, but the total Employee numbers (Group) for 2021 is given as 28949. Since the table specifies that the Permanent employees are a subset of the Employee numbers (Group), we can infer that the Permanent employees for 2021 should be less than 28949.

In the third table, the Permanent employees for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided, but the Employee turnover (Group) for 2021 is given as 3869. Since the table specifies that the Permanent employees are not part of the Employee turnover, we cannot directly infer the number of Permanent employees for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Permanent employees in the year 2021?" is '28725' from the first table.

Are you sure that '22.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:39:56.460 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for "Incidents of work-related noise-induced hearing loss" shows values for 2023, 2022, and an arrow symbol "<" for 2021.
- The arrow symbol "<" indicates that the value for 2021 is less than the value for 2022.
- Therefore, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in 2021 is less than 23.
- It is not explicitly stated, but based on the information provided, we can conclude that the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in 2021 is less than 23.

For the second table:
- The row for "Incidents of work-related noise-induced hearing loss" shows values for 2023, 2022, and an arrow symbol "V" for 2021.
- The arrow symbol "V" indicates that the value for 2021 is variable or unspecified.
- Therefore, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

For the third table:
- The row for "Noise-induced hearing loss" shows values for 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
- The value for Noise-induced hearing loss in 2021 is explicitly stated as 22.
- Therefore, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in 2021 in this table is 22.

Based on the analysis of each table individually, the correct answer to the question "What was the Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021?" is '22.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:40:05.571 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Investment in bursary scheme (R million) for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - For the year 2021, the Investment in bursary scheme is not explicitly provided in the table. The values are given for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but not for 2021.

2. **Table 2:**

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:40:16.069 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for "Land used for mining (hectare)" in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are given as 28743, 29073, and 30376 respectively. Since the value for 2021 is not directly stated, we cannot definitively say that it is 29073.0.

Looking at the second table, the value for "Land used for mining (hectare)" in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. Only the value for 2022 is given as "I" which does not correspond to a numerical value for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the value for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the value for "Surface area affected by operations (hectares)" in the year 2021 is given as 20812. This table does not contain information about "Land used for mining (hectare)" specifically, so we cannot use this value to answer the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that the Land used for mining (hectare) in the year 2021 is 29073.0.

Are you sure that '66273.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:40:26.425 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 66273 in the table, but it is not clear if this value corresponds to the year 2021.

In the second table, there is no information provided for the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) for the year 2021.

In the third table, the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 66273 in the table, but it is not clear if this value corresponds to the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to definitively state that '66273.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) in the year 2021?". 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '0.59' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:40:37.885 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '1.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of assets under management for this specific asset class in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the assets under management for the asset class "CHEMICALS" is provided as 1.70. Therefore, the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is indeed 1.70.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the assets under management for the asset class "CHEMICALS" is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of assets under management for this specific asset class in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:40:57.060 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the volume of recycled waste in 2021 is given as 124 kilotons. However, it is not specified whether this includes food waste recovered or not. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that the volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 is 124 kilotons from this table.

In the third table, the volume of recycled waste in 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 is 124.0 kilotons. 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:02.245 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the "Area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation" is listed as 6147.00 hectares. This value does not specifically refer to forestland but rather to the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively state that 6147.0 hectares is the correct answer to the question regarding the area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no specific mention of forestland or a similar category related to forest management. The table provides data on the surface area affected by operations and energy, but not on forestland specifically.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the "Area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation" is listed as 6147.00 hectares. Similar to the first table, this value does not explicitly refer to forestland but rather to the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively confirm that 6147.0 hectares is the correct answer to the question regarding the area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:11.290 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no information provided about the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for any specific year, so we cannot determine the attendance rate for the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the row "Independent assurance practitioner's assurance report" has a value of 63, but this does not correspond to the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the attendance rate for the year 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, there is no specific mention of the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021. The table provides data on Recordable Case Rate (RCR) and Employee, but not on the Audit committee meeting attendance rate.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:16.989 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the answer to the question about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

Table 1:
- There is no specific mention of the number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021 in this table.

Table 2:
- The row "R1 348 MILLION | R21,17 | Employee Study Aid" does not provide information about the number of hours of training.
- The row "R1 348 MILLION | R15,27 | Technicians and Inspectors in Training" also does not mention the number of hours of training.

Table 3:
- The row "Occupational safety and HSI programme | 12" does mention the number '12', but it is not explicitly stated that this number represents the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.
- The row "Occupational health | 13" mentions the number '13', but it is related to occupational health, not specifically to health, safety, and emergency response training.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:21.890 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021 is explicitly mentioned.

Table 1:
- No information related to health, safety, or emergency response training is provided in this table.

Table 2:
- The table mentions "Occupational safety and HSI programme" with a value of 12. However, it does not specify if this value represents the average number of hours of training for contract employees in the year 2021.

Table 3:
- No information related to health, safety, or emergency response training for contract employees is provided in this table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in any of the tables.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '59.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:32.159 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. The table seems to focus on investments in talent development programs rather than procurement spend.

Moving on to the second table, the row for the year 2021 shows the following information:
- B-BBEE (RSA only)
  - Black-owned spend: 23800

Based on this information, we can calculate the percentage of the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. To do this, we need the total spend for the year 2021, which is not explicitly provided in the table. Without the total spend value, we cannot accurately calculate the requested percentage.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." cannot be determined from the information given in the tables.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:41.797 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - No specific information is provided about Contractor costs or income statement for the year 2021 in this table.

2. **Table 2:**
   - No specific information is provided about Contractor costs or income statement for the year 2021 in this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table provides information about Preferential procurement from all suppliers for the years 2021, 2020, 2022, and 2023.
   - The value for 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, the value '33458.0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 because none of the tables provide the specific information for that year.

**Conclusion: No**

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:45.600 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we see that there is no specific value provided for the total number of person hours worked. Therefore, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement for the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, we see that there are two rows for the year 2021:
1. TOTAL | R487,28 | Employee Training and Development
2. TOTAL | R334,58 | Other (License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads)

The second row mentions "Other (License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads)" with a value of R334,58. This value does not explicitly represent Corporate office costs per income statement for the year 2021. It includes various other expenses as well.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that '334,58' is the correct answer to the question regarding Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:41:50.689 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to the Centre for shared value management and Responsible sourcing and procurement, but there is no direct indication of the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the row labeled "TOTAL" includes the value R334,58, which seems to be a formatting error as it should likely be R334.58. However, this value does not directly correspond to the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Considering the information provided in both tables, there is no clear indication of the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the tables provided, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '14.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021? "?

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:04.234 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021. The value '14.0' is not provided in this table for that specific topic in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no mention of the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021. The value '14.0' is not provided in this table for that specific topic in the year 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no direct reference to the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021. The value '14.0' is not explicitly stated in this table for that specific topic in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021?" is no.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:10.829 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the value '14.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of process safety to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021.

1. Table 1:
   - For the row related to Process safety in the year 2021, the value provided is 14. Therefore, the discussion of process safety is mentioned with a value of 14 for the year 2021 in Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - There is no mention of Process safety in Table 2 for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm the value for the discussion of process safety in this table for the specified year.

3. Table 3:
   - For the row related to Process safety in the year 2021, the value provided is 14. Therefore, the discussion of process safety is mentioned with a value of 14 for the year 2021 in Table 3.

Based on the analysis of each table, we can confirm that the value '14.0' is mentioned for the discussion of process safety to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021 in Table 1 and Table 3. However, Table 2 does not provide information on this topic for the specified year.

Are you sure that '0.59' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Duration of strikes and lockouts in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:17.111 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific row related to the "Duration of strikes and lockouts" for any of the years mentioned (2023, 2022, 2021, 2020). Therefore, we cannot determine the duration of strikes and lockouts in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, there is no information related to the "Duration of strikes and lockouts" for the year 2021. The rows in this table are about the Occupational diseases incident rate and Incidents of work-related noise-induced hearing loss, not about strikes and lockouts.

Looking at the third table, there is also no information provided about the "Duration of strikes and lockouts" for the year 2021. The rows in this table are about Incidents of work-related noise-induced hearing loss and Mining occupational diseases.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Duration of strikes and lockouts in the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No
