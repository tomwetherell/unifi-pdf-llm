Are you sure that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:02.821 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) value is provided for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The value for 2021 is given as 124.00 kilotons. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '124.00'.

Looking at the second table, the Nitrous Oxide (N2O) (kilotons) value is provided for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The value for 2021 is given as 1.63 Rm. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Nitrous Oxide (N2O) (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '1.63'.

Looking at the third table, the Waste kilotons (kt) values are provided for the years 2023 and 2022. The value for Hazardous waste generation in 2021 is not explicitly stated, so we cannot determine the exact value for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '124.00'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:07.213 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table, there is no specific value provided for Sulphur oxides (SOx) in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct value for that year from this table.

Moving on to the second markdown table, again, there is no value specified for Sulphur oxides (SOx) in the year 2021. Hence, we cannot determine the correct value for that year from this table either.

Finally, in the third markdown table, the value provided for Sulphur oxides (SOx) in the year 2021 is 181.10 kilotons.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct value for Sulphur oxides (SOx) in the year 2021 is indeed 181.10 kilotons.

Are you sure that '63.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2 ) Scope 2 (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:28.715 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The table provides data for the years 2023 and 2022. There is no information provided for the year 2021. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the value for "Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) Scope 2 (kilotons) in the year 2021" from this table.

For the second table:

The table provides data for the years 2023 and 2022. There is no information provided for the year 2021. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the value for "Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) Scope 2 (kilotons) in the year 2021" from this table.

For the third table:

The table provides data for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, the row corresponding to "Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) Scope 2 (kilotons)" is not provided for any of these years. The only information available is for "Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) Scope 3 (kilotons)" in 2021, which is not the same as the requested data.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the value for "Indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) Scope 2 (kilotons) in the year 2021" cannot be determined.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:32.248 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Hazardous waste generation for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for Hazardous waste in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Hazardous waste generation is not even mentioned, so we cannot find the value for 2021 from this table either.

Moving on to the third table, the Hazardous waste for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 320 kilotons. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '320.0'.

So, the answer is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '3221.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Natural gas (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Are you sure that '8.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Investment in learning as a % of payroll in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:46.379 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll is not explicitly provided. The values given are 6.1 for 2023, 5.8 for 2022, and 5.9 for 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll is indeed provided as 8.0. 

Considering each table individually, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll for the year 2021 is 8.0 according to the second table.

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:31:59.259 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for Human Capital, the turnover for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, but the turnover for 2021 is missing. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that '3869.0' is the correct answer for the turnover in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for Natural Capital, the turnover for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, but the turnover for 2021 is missing. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table as well, we cannot confirm that '3869.0' is the correct answer for the turnover in the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for Human Capital again, the turnover for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '3869'. Therefore, based on the information provided in this specific table, '3869.0' is indeed the correct answer for the turnover in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:32:08.110 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Social Investment Spend for Environment and biodiversity in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the Social Investment Spend for Environment and biodiversity in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '13.2'. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Social Investment Spend - Environment and biodiversity in the year 2021?" is '13.2'.

Considering each table individually, the answer is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '23800.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE (RSA only) - Black-owned spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:32:23.503 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Black-owned spend for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values are given for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no value specified for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact Black-owned spend for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the Black-owned women spend for the year 2021 is given as 15800. This table does not provide the Black-owned spend for the same year, so we cannot determine the Black-owned spend for 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, the Black-owned spend for the year 2021 is given as 23800. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE (RSA only) - Black-owned spend in the year 2021?" based on this table is 23800.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

| Human Capital - Our people                    |   2023 |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   | LoA 2023   | Footnote   |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| Total number of person hours worked (million) | 148.69 | 132.52 |        |        |            |            |
| - Employee                                    |  62.08 |  59.86 |        |        |            |            |

The total number of person hours worked (million) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '130.94' is the correct answer for this table.

For the second table:

| Human Capital - Our people                    |   2023 | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | LoA 2023   | Footnote   |

| Total number of person hours worked (million) | 162.52 | 146.70 | 130.94 | 162.60 |            |            |

The total number of person hours worked (million) for the year 2021 in this table is indeed '130.94'.

For the third table:

| Human Capital - Our people                    |   2023 |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   | LoA 2023   | Footnote   |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| Total number of person hours worked (million) |  12.79 |  13.23 |        |        |            |            |
| - Employee                                    |   8.26 |   8.48 |        |        |            |            |

The total number of person hours worked (million) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '130.94' is the correct answer for this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total number of person hours worked (million) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '22.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:32:45.145 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

Are you sure that '46.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Investment in bursary scheme (R million) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:32:51.784 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Investment in bursary scheme (R million) for 2021: 46.7

2. **Table 2:**
   - Investment in bursary scheme (R million) for 2021: 46.7

3. **Table 3:**
   - There is no specific row for the year 2021 in this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Investment in bursary scheme (R million) for the year 2021 is indeed 46.7 in both Table 1 and Table 2. Table 3 does not provide information for the year 2021.

**Conclusion: Yes**

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 46.7 R million in rand?

Are you sure that '103776.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Water recycled (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:32:56.570 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for "Water recycled (thousand cubic meters)" in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, there is no information related to "Water recycled (thousand cubic meters)" or the year 2021. So, we cannot find the value for 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, the value for "Water recycled (thousand cubic meters)" in the year 2021 is indeed provided as 103776. Therefore, based on the information in the third table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Water recycled (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021?" is '103776.0'.

Are you sure that '3.65' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG intensity (CO2 equivalent/ton product meant for external sale) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:33:03.527 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the GHG intensity (CO2 e/ton of product meant for external sale) values are provided for the years 2023 and 2022, but there is no specific value mentioned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the GHG intensity for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the GHG intensity values are provided for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The value for 2021 is given as 3.65.

In the third table, the GHG intensity values are provided for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The value for 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the GHG intensity (CO2 equivalent/ton product meant for external sale) in the year 2021 is 3.65 according to the second table.

Are you sure that '1182.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:33:27.013 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value for the assets under management for the asset class "CHEMICALS" is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of assets under management for this specific asset class in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the assets under management for the asset class "CHEMICALS" is provided as 1.70. Therefore, the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is indeed 1.70.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the assets under management for the asset class "CHEMICALS" is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of assets under management for this specific asset class in the year 2021 from this table.

So, the correct answer is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 147.09 None in rand?

Moving on to the second table, the volume of recycled waste in 2021 is given as 124 kilotons. However, it is not specified whether this includes food waste or not. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that the volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 is 124 kilotons from this table.

In the third table, the volume of recycled waste in 2021 is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 is 124.0.

Are you sure that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:33:45.035 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation is listed as 6147.00 hectares. This does not specifically mention forestland, so we cannot definitively state that 6147.0 hectares is the correct answer to the question about the area of forestland managed by the entity in 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no specific mention of forestland. The only data provided is for the surface area affected by operations, which is not directly related to forestland.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation is again listed as 6147.00 hectares. Similar to the first table, this does not explicitly mention forestland.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively confirm that 6147.0 hectares is the correct answer to the question about the area of forestland managed by the entity in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:33:57.699 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the answer to the question about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

1. Table 1:
   - There is no specific mention of the number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021 in this table. The focus areas mentioned are "Safe and enduring operations" and "Occupational safety and HSI programme," but no specific hours are provided.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training for the year 2021 from Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - In this table, under the row "Occupational safety and HSI programme," it is mentioned that 12 hours of training were provided.
   - However, this table does not provide information specifically for the year 2021. The information is general and does not specify the year.
   - Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the average number of hours of training for the year 2021 from Table 2.

3. Table 3:
   - In this table, under the row "Occupational safety and HSI programme," it is mentioned that 12 hours of training were provided.
   - Additionally, under the row "Occupational health," it is mentioned that 13 hours of training were provided.
   - The table does not specify the year for which these training hours were provided.
   - Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the average number of hours of training for the year 2021 from Table 3.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot accurately determine the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '1527.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the The average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:34:05.409 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific information provided about the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021. The values in the table seem to be related to different topics or programs, but not specifically about training hours on anti-corruption issues.

Moving on to the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question (2021) mentions "Technicians and Inspectors in Training" but does not provide a specific number of hours for training on anti-corruption issues. The values mentioned in the row seem to be related to financial figures or categories of training, not specifically about the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to determine that the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 is 1527.0. 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:34:18.546 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

There is no specific information provided about the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021. The table only mentions the allocation of funds for bursaries, technical coaches, and mentors. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021 from this table.

For the second markdown table:

Similar to the first table, there is no information given about the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021. The table lists the allocation of funds for technical coaches, mentors, and employee study aid. Hence, we cannot ascertain the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021 from this table.

For the third markdown table:

The table provides data on the occupational levels and the number of individuals in each category, but it does not specify the age range of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021. The information in this table pertains to the gender and occupational level distribution, not the specific age range of Board members.

Conclusion: No, we cannot determine the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021 from any of the provided markdown tables.

2. **Table 2:**
   - No specific information about Contractor costs or income statement for the year 2021 is provided in this table.

3. **Table 3:**

Are you sure that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:34:28.708 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific information provided about the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021. The table mainly mentions the Centre for shared value management and Responsible sourcing and procurement without detailing the cost related to acquisition.

Moving on to the second table, the row labeled "TOTAL" shows an amount of R334,58, but it is not clear if this amount specifically relates to the cost of acquisition per income statement in the year 2021. The description "Other (License Fees, Training Opex and Overheads)" does not directly indicate that this amount is related to the cost of acquisition.

In the third table, again, there is no explicit mention of the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021. The table lists Development sponsorships and Centre for shared value management without providing detailed cost information.

Therefore, based on the information presented in the tables, it is not possible to definitively state that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Consider the following markdown tables:

Are you sure that '14.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:34:44.681 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of a discussion related to processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021. The values provided in the table do not align with the question asked.

Moving on to the second table, there is also no direct mention of a discussion related to processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021. The values provided in this table do not correspond to the question asked.

Lastly, in the third table, there is a mention of "Environmental incident management" and "Air quality management" but no specific mention of a discussion related to processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '14.0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '14.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:34:48.704 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 is for "Process safety" with a value of 14. However, this value does not directly relate to the discussion of identifying and managing emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety.

Moving on to the second table, the row for the year 2021 is for "Sustainable plastics" with a value of 26. This value also does not provide information on the discussion of emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety.

In the third table, the row for the year 2021 is for "Process safety" with a value of 14. This value could potentially be related to the discussion of identifying and managing emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021 is **'14'** from the third table.

Conclusion: **Yes**
