Answer:

2024-03-07 21:43:40.901 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for Particulates (fly ash) in kilotons for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are given as 10.3, 8.2, and 8.22 respectively. Since the value for 2021 is not explicitly stated, we cannot definitively say that '8.2' is the correct answer for the year 2021.

In the second table, the value for Particulates (fly ash) in kilotons for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 8.20. Therefore, '8.2' is the correct answer for the year 2021 in this table.

In the third table, the value for Particulates (fly ash) in kilotons for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are given as 10.3, 8.2, and 8.22 respectively. Since the value for 2021 is not explicitly stated, we cannot definitively say that '8.2' is the correct answer for the year 2021.

Conclusion: 
Based on the information provided in the tables, '8.2' is the correct answer for the year 2021 in the second table, but it cannot be confirmed for the first and third tables.

Are you sure that '27.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Indicator of Performance (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:43:43.760 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Indicator of Performance (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.

Are you sure that '0.19' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value added statement (unaudited) - Employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Are you sure that '320.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:02.581 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Hazardous waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, 2020, and the level of assurance for 2023. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for Hazardous waste in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Hazardous waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is given as 320. This matches the value mentioned in the question.

In the third table, the Hazardous waste generation for 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023 and 2022 for both Hazardous and Non-hazardous waste generation.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '320.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?".

Are you sure that '0.14' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:06.465 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are given for the Employee category, but the specific value for 2021 is missing.

In the second table, there is no data provided for any year under the Lost Work Day Case Rate (LWDCR) category, so we cannot determine the value for 2021.

In the third table, the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 0.14 under the Service provider category.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) in the year 2021?" is 'Yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:14.992 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, again, the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table either.

Looking at the third table, the Non-hazardous waste generation for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023 and 2022. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confidently say that '181.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?". 

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.26' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Recordable Case Rate (RCR) in the year 2021? "?

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:28.639 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Recordable Case Rate (RCR) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 0.26. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Recordable Case Rate (RCR) in the year 2021?" based on the first table is '0.26'.

Looking at the second table, the Recordable Case Rate (RCR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the RCR for the year 2021 based on the second table.

Looking at the third table, the Recordable Case Rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the RCR for the year 2021 based on the third table.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Recordable Case Rate (RCR) in the year 2021?" is '0.26' only from the first table.

The values for 2021 are given for other metrics, but turnover for 2021 is missing. Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot confirm that the turnover in the year 2021 was 3869.0.

In the second table, the turnover for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 3869. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we can confirm that the turnover in the year 2021 was 3869.0.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '144.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Social Investment Spend - Community health and infrastructure in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:39.120 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Social Investment Spend for Community health and infrastructure in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that the Social Investment Spend for Community health and infrastructure in 2021 was 144.0.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of Social Investment Spend for Community health and infrastructure or any specific values for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Social Investment Spend for Community health and infrastructure in 2021 from this table either.

Based on the information provided in both tables, we cannot definitively say that the Social Investment Spend for Community health and infrastructure in the year 2021 was 144.0.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:44:46.828 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021 is given as 9509. This means that '9509.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question: "What was the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021?".

Looking at the second table, the Direct taxes paid to government in the year 2021 is also given as 9509. Therefore, the answer remains the same.

Looking at the third table, there is no information provided for the year 2021, so we cannot determine the Direct taxes paid to government for that year from this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:45:20.432 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2022 and 2023 are given as 23 and 17, respectively. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021 is explicitly given as 23. So, '22.0' is not the correct answer based on this table.

In the third table, the value for Noise-induced hearing loss in the year 2021 is explicitly given as 22. Therefore, '22.0' is the correct answer based on this table.

The values are given for 2023 and 2022, but not for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Potable water use for the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, again, the Potable water use for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The values are given for 2023 and 2022, but not for 2021. Hence, we cannot determine the Potable water use for the year 2021 from this table either.

Lastly, in the third table, the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 13357. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '13357.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:45:37.176 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is given as '499'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '499'.

Looking at the second table, the Total waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The only waste-related data for 2021 in this table is for Non-hazardous waste, which is '181'. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total waste for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Total waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The only waste-related data for 2021 in this table is for Total recycled waste, which is '131'. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total waste for 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '48728.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:11.765 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no explicit mention of ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to Employee Study Aid and Technicians and Inspectors in Training.

Moving on to the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question does not provide information about ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021. The values mentioned are for Employee Training and Development and Other expenses.

Finally, in the third table, there is no specific mention of ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021. The values listed are for Other expenses including License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads.

Based on the information provided in the markdown tables, it is not possible to determine the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.14' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:14.566 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for the year 2021 shows the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) as 0.14. This value represents the rate of lost workday cases, not the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked). Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:23.437 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to the assets under management that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues is not explicitly provided. The value '68707' is associated with the "Wealth distribution" row, which does not directly correspond to the assets under management with ESG integration.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the row related to the assets under management with ESG integration is also not explicitly provided. The value '68707' is again associated with the "Wealth distribution" row.

Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, the row related to the assets under management with ESG integration is not explicitly provided. The value '21115' is associated with the "CHEMICALS" row, which is not relevant to the assets under management with ESG integration.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '68707.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the assets under management with ESG integration in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:27.810 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the table "Natural Capital - Our environment":

The row "Wealth distribution" does not provide information on the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in this table for the year 2021.

For the table "Sasol in Society - Spend":

The row "Social investment (SI) spend" provides information on the social investment spend for the year 2021, which is 526.2. However, this value represents the amount spent on social investment and not the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in this table for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021?" is **no**.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:39.629 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we see that the Total recycled waste is provided as 131 kt, but there is no specific value mentioned for Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we find that the Recycled waste (kilotons) is given as 124 kt. However, this value represents the total recycled waste and not specifically Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Considering both tables, we do not have a direct and explicit value for Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021. Hence, we cannot confirm if '124.0' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:48.696 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row "Area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation" shows a value of '6147.00' hectares. This value represents the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation in 2021, not specifically the area of forestland owned. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot conclusively state that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the area of forestland owned in 2021.

Are you sure that '13.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:46:56.164 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the answer to the question about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

1. Table 1:
   - This table does not provide any information related to the average number of hours of training for full-time employees. Therefore, we cannot find the answer in this table.

2. Table 2:
   - The row "Employee and service provider fatal injury frequency rate" does not provide information about training hours.
   - The row "Total major and significant fires, explosions and releases" does not mention training hours either.
   - Therefore, we cannot find the answer in this table.

3. Table 3:
   - The row "Occupational safety and HSI programme" does not specify the average number of hours of training for full-time employees.
   - The row "Occupational health" also does not provide information on training hours.
   - Therefore, we cannot find the answer in this table.

Based on the analysis of all three tables, none of them provide information on the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No, the answer '13.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:02.448 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table for "Natural Capital - Our environment," the row for "Preferential procurement (score out of 27)" provides the scores for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, there is no specific value provided for the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it is not possible to determine the exact value for the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021.

Are you sure that '21.17' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:06.812 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no explicit mention of BBBEE procurement spend or EMEs in the context provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer to the question from this table.

Moving on to the second table, we see a row mentioning "R1 348 MILLION" and "R21,17" under the column for Employee Study Aid. However, this does not directly relate to BBBEE procurement spend from all EMEs as a % of total spend in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the answer from this table either.

Considering the third table, there is no mention of BBBEE procurement spend or EMEs in the context provided. Thus, we cannot derive the answer from this table.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot determine the BBBEE procurement spend from all EMEs as a % of total spend in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.

Are you sure that '104.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:12.315 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the row corresponding to "Senior management" provides the breakdown of male and female employees at different occupational levels. The value of '104' is given for "Male (M) - I" in the year 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021?" is **no** because the value of '104' corresponds to the "Male (M) - I" category, not Board members between 30 - 50.

So, the correct answer is **no**.

Are you sure that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:18.050 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The table only mentions "TOTAL R334,58" without specifying the breakdown of costs related to contractors. Therefore, we cannot determine the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, again, the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 are not explicitly stated. The table mentions "TOTAL R334,58" under the category "Other (License Fees, Training Opex)", but it does not specify the exact amount attributed to Contractor costs. Therefore, we cannot determine the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 from this table either.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no mention of Contractor costs or any related expenses for the year 2021. The table provides information on Employee Study Aid and Technicians and Inspectors in Training, but it does not include any details on Contractor costs.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot confirm that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:21.238 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - No specific mention of Corporate office costs or income statement for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement in 2021 from this table.

2. Table 2:
   - No relevant information provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement in 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - The table seems to be related to environmental data and GHG intensity, not Corporate office costs or income statement.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, we do not have any information to determine the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:47:26.584 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table, there is no specific mention of the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to Employee Training and Development, License Fees, and Training Opex. Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second markdown table, again, there is no direct mention of the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021. The values provided in this table are related to Other expenses such as License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we also cannot determine that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.

Lastly, looking at the third markdown table, the table seems to be related to reporting frameworks and standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. There is no information related to the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three markdown tables, we cannot confirm that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.
