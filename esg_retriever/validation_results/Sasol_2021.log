Answer:

2024-03-08 23:04:02.486 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table "Natural Capital - Our environment", the Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) value for the year 2021 is given as 181.1. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

For the second table "Sasol in Society - Spend", the Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) value is not provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Sulphur oxides (SOx) value for the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table "Natural Capital - Our environment", the Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) value for the year 2021 is given as 181.10. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is 'no'.

Conclusion: The Sulphur oxides (SOx) (kilotons) value for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 181.1 in the first table, so the answer is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '27.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Indicator of Performance (kilotons) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:04:09.068 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Indicator of Performance (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values are given for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no value specified for 2021.

In the second table, the value for the year 2021 is indeed provided as 27.80 kilotons.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Indicator of Performance (kilotons) in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is 'yes'.

Therefore, the value for the B-BBEE verification certificate in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided as "4.0" in this table.

Moving on to the second table, the B-BBEE verification certificate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the row corresponding to that year. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the B-BBEE verification certificate in the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively state that "4.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the B-BBEE verification certificate in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.14' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:04:29.010 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are given for the Employee category, but the value for 2021 is missing.

In the second table, there is no data provided for any year under the Lost Work Day Case Rate (LWDCR) category, so we cannot determine the value for 2021.

In the third table, the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) for the year 2021 is indeed provided as 0.14 under the Service provider category.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR) in the year 2021?" is 'Yes'.

The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) is not mentioned at all. So, we cannot determine the value for 2021 from this table either.

Finally, in the third table, the Non-hazardous waste generation for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The values provided are for 2023 and 2022. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '181.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?".

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:04:52.260 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the turnover for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for turnover are given for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, but the specific turnover value for 2021 is missing. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the turnover for the year 2021.

In the second table, the turnover for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 3869. Therefore, the turnover for the year 2021 in the second table is indeed 3869.

In the third table, there is no turnover information provided, so we cannot determine the turnover for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: 
The turnover for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 3869 in the second table, but it is not explicitly provided in the first table. Therefore, the correct answer is 'No'.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '144.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Social Investment Spend - Community health and infrastructure in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot confirm that the Social Investment Spend - Community health and infrastructure in 2021 was 144.0.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of Social Investment Spend - Community health and infrastructure. The table provides information about Bridge-to-work and Community health and service infrastructure programme, but not about the specific spend related to Community health and infrastructure.

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, we cannot confirm that the Social Investment Spend - Community health and infrastructure in 2021 was 144.0.

Are you sure that '224.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Non-permanent employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:06:28.620 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Non-permanent employees in the year 2021 is given as '224'. So, '224' is the correct answer to the question for the first table.

Looking at the second table, the Non-permanent employees in the year 2021 is also given as '224'. So, '224' is the correct answer to the question for the second table.

Looking at the third table, the Non-permanent employees in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. However, based on the trend in the other tables, it is likely that the value for 2021 would also be '224'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '224' is the most likely correct answer to the question "What was the Non-permanent employees in the year 2021?".

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:06:31.460 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Permanent employees count is given as 28725. However, in the second table for the same year, the Permanent employees count is not explicitly provided. Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, the Employee numbers (Group) are given as 28949, but the breakdown of Permanent employees within this total is not specified.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively conclude that the Permanent employees count for the year 2021 is 28725. It is possible that this value is correct, but we do not have enough specific data to confirm it.

Are you sure that '13357.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:06:40.236 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Potable water use for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023 and 2022 only. Therefore, we cannot determine the Potable water use for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, again, the Potable water use for the year 2021 is not explicitly given. The values are provided for 2023 and 2022 only. Hence, we cannot determine the Potable water use for 2021 from this table either.

Finally, in the third table, the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 13357. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '13357.0'.

Conclusion: No, we cannot determine the Potable water (thousand cubic meters) for the year 2021 from the first two tables, but we can determine it from the third table.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:06:46.028 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Investment in bursary scheme (R million) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020 and 2022 are given as 59.6 and 75.6, respectively. Since the value for 2021 is not mentioned, we cannot definitively say that it was 46.7.

Looking at the second table, there is no specific mention of the Investment in bursary scheme for any year. The values provided are for the Graduate Development Programme and Bursaries, but not for the Investment in bursary scheme.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '46.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Investment in bursary scheme (R million) in the year 2021?".

The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total waste (kilotons) for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the Total waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total waste (kilotons) for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Total waste (kilotons) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 181 kilotons under the Non-hazardous waste (kilotons) row. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total waste (kilotons) in the year 2021?" is '181.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:03.528 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the River water use in thousand cubic meters for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the River water in the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the River water (thousand cubic meters) for the year 2021 is given as 108559. This means that the River water (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021 is indeed 108559.

In the third table, the River water (thousand cubic meters) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the River water in the year 2021 from this table.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the River water (thousand cubic meters) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:07.664 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 66273 in the previous row, but it is not clear if this value corresponds to 2021 or not.

Moving on to the second table, the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) is not present, so we cannot determine the value for 2021 from this table.

In the third table, there is no information about the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) for any year, so we cannot find the value for 2021 here either.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that '66273.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) (kilotons) in the year 2021?".

Moving on to the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question shows that the total Employee Training and Development expenses were R487,28. However, this does not specifically mention ALL Administration expenses. 

In the third table, the row corresponding to the year in question mentions Other expenses such as License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads totaling R334,58. Again, this does not explicitly state the ALL Administration expenses.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we do not have a direct value for ALL Administration expenses in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021?" is 'No'.

Are you sure that '0.14' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:26.924 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for the year 2021 is related to the "Lost Workday Case Rate (LWDCR)".

Are you sure that '68707.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:33.829 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row that seems to be related to the question about the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues is "Wealth distribution" with a value of 68707. However, it is important to note that the table does not explicitly state that this value represents the assets under management by asset class that employ integration of ESG issues. The table lacks specific information or context to definitively confirm that 68707.0 is the correct answer to the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the answer is inconclusive. 

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:37.483 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the table "Natural Capital - Our environment":

The row "Wealth distribution" does not provide information on the amount of assets under management related to social issues. Therefore, the value of '526.2' is not mentioned in this table for the year 2021.

For the table "Sasol in Society - Spend":

The row "Social investment (SI) spend" provides information on the social investment spend for the year 2021, which is 526.2. However, this value does not represent the amount of assets under management related to social issues. It simply indicates the amount spent on social investment.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:43.384 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value provided for "CHEMICALS" is 21115. This seems to be the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management that employ sustainability themed screening in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:47.826 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we see that the Total recycled waste is provided as 131 kt, but there is no specific value mentioned for Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we find that the Recycled waste (kilotons) is given as 124 kt. However, this value represents the total recycled waste and not specifically the Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that '124.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Considering both tables, we do not have a direct and specific value for the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021. 

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:07:54.291 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to the area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation shows a value of 6147.00 hectares. This value does not specifically mention forestland, but it does indicate an area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation. Without further context or clarification within the table, it is not explicitly stated that this value represents the area of forestland managed by the entity in 2021.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the first table, I cannot definitively say that '6147.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the area of forestland managed by the entity in 2021.

Are you sure that '23.86' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:08:08.049 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table for "Natural Capital - Our environment," the table does not provide the specific value for the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021. The table only lists the BBBEE verification certificate levels for each year and the Preferential procurement scores, but it does not provide the specific percentage value for QSEs in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the value of '23.86' for the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 cannot be confirmed.

Moving on to the second table, we see a row mentioning "R1 348 MILLION" and "Employee Study Aid." However, this does not directly relate to BBBEE procurement spend from all EMEs. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer from this table either.

Lastly, in the third table, there is a row mentioning "TOTAL" and "Other (License Fees, Training Opex and Overheads)." Again, there is no direct mention of BBBEE procurement spend from all EMEs in the context provided.

Based on the information available in the provided tables, we cannot determine the BBBEE procurement spend from all EMEs as a % of total spend in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:08:17.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the row for "Top management" shows the following distribution for males: 8 in category A, 2 in category C, 4 in category I, and 11 in category W. For females, there are 6 in category A, 0 in category C, 2 in category -, and 2 in category W. There are 0 foreign nationals for both males and females in the top management category.

Therefore, the total number of Board members (which typically fall under the top management category) between the ages of 30 - 50 in the year 2021 is calculated as follows:
8 (M - A) + 2 (M - C) + 4 (M - I) + 11 (M - W) + 6 (F - A) + 0 (F - C) + 2 (F - -) + 2 (F - W) + 0 (Foreign nationals - M) + 0 (Foreign nationals - F) = 35

So, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021?" is '35'.

year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:08:23.639 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The values mentioned in the table are R334,58 and R487,28, but it is not clear which one corresponds to the Contractor costs for the year in question.

In the second table, the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 are also not explicitly stated. The values mentioned are R487,28 and R334,58, but again, it is not specified which one represents the Contractor costs for the year in question.

In the third table, the Contractor costs per income statement for the year 2021 are not explicitly given. The values provided are R21,17 and R15,27, but it is not clear if these correspond to the Contractor costs for the year in question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, I cannot confidently determine that '33458.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:08:27.699 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - There is no specific mention of Corporate office costs or income statement for the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement for 2021 from this table.

2. Table 2:
   - This table also does not provide any information about Corporate office costs or income statement for the year 2021. Hence, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement for 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - The table provides information related to Natural Capital and environmental factors, but it does not mention Corporate office costs or income statement for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot find the Corporate office costs per income statement for 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of all three tables, none of them provide the necessary information to determine the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:08:32.034 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table, there is no specific mention of the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to Employee Training and Development, License Fees, and Training Opex. Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second markdown table, again, there is no direct mention of the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021. The values provided in this table are related to License Fees, Training Opex, and Overheads. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we also cannot determine that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.

Lastly, looking at the third markdown table, the table seems to be related to reporting frameworks and standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. There is no information related to the Cost of sales as per income statement for the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three markdown tables, we cannot confirm that '48728.0' is the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021.
