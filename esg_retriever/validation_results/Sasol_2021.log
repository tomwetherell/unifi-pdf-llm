In the table provided, the row "Land and biodiversity (hectares)" has data for the years 2022 and 2020, but there is no specific data provided for the year 2021. Since there is no data explicitly mentioned for the year 2021 in the table, we cannot determine the Area dedicated to biodiversity and conservation (hectares) for that year from this table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '28725.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value added statement (unaudited) - Employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

2024-03-09 15:29:50.941 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021, we need to look for the row that specifically mentions hazardous waste and then locate the value under the column for the year 2021.

Looking at the provided markdown table, we can see that there is no row explicitly labeled as "Hazardous waste (kilotons)." The closest relevant row is "Non-hazardous waste (kilotons)," which indicates that the table does not contain data for hazardous waste specifically.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot find the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '8.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Investment in learning as a % of payroll in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:30:56.282 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the Investment in learning as a % of payroll in 2021 was 8.0.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll is explicitly stated as 8.0. Therefore, in this case, we can confirm that the Investment in learning as a % of payroll in 2021 was indeed 8.0.

Conclusion: 
No, the Investment in learning as a % of payroll in the year 2021 is not definitively 8.0 based on the information provided in the first table, but it is 8.0 based on the information provided in the second table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

In this case, the closest category we have is "Land and biodiversity (hectares)" and "Surface area affected by operations (hectares)".

Looking at the table, we can see that the data for the year 2021 is not provided for the "Land and biodiversity (hectares)" category. However, the "Surface area affected by operations (hectares)" category does have data for the year 2021, which is 20812.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '18.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Social Investment Spend - Enterprise and supplier development in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:32:34.463 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:

The Social Investment Spend for Enterprise and supplier development in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values given are for 2023, 2022, and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot confirm that the spend for Enterprise and supplier development in 2021 was 18.1 Rm.

For the second table:

Looking at the table, we can see two rows with financial amounts and descriptions. The second row with "R1 348 MILLION" and "R73,81" under the "Bursaries" column seems to be related to bursaries. The amount "R73,81" could potentially represent the bursary amount allocated for either undergraduate or postgraduate students.

However, the table does not explicitly mention whether these bursaries are for undergraduate or postgraduate students. Without further context or clarification within the table, we cannot definitively determine if the bursaries mentioned are specifically for undergraduate or postgraduate students.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot conclusively determine the Undergraduate and postgraduate bursaries in the year 2021.

2024-03-09 15:33:28.075 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Permanent employees for the year 2021 is listed as 28725. However, in the second table, the Permanent employees for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided, but the total Employee numbers (Group) for 2021 is given as 28949. 

Given that the total Employee numbers (Group) includes Permanent employees, it is possible that the Permanent employees for 2021 is not exactly 28725 but rather a part of the total Employee numbers (Group) which is 28949. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not certain that '28725.0' is the correct answer to the question "What was the Permanent employees in the year 2021?".

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:33:31.043 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: Yes

Explanation:
1. The question asks for the total number of person hours worked in the year 2021.
2. Looking at the markdown table, we can see a row specifically mentioning "Total number of person hours worked (million)" with columns for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
3. The value for the year 2021 is missing in the table, indicated by an empty cell under the column for 2021.
4. Since the table is structured to provide data for each year, the missing value for 2021 suggests that the information for that year is not available in the table.
5. Therefore, the total number of person hours worked in the year 2021 cannot be found in this markdown table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that "46.7" is the correct answer for the Investment in bursary scheme in 2021.

Looking at the second table, there is no information related to the Investment in bursary scheme for any year. The values provided in this table are for different categories of expenses, not specifically for bursaries or for the year 2021.

Given:
- Non-hazardous waste generation for 2022 = 223 kt
- Total recycled waste for 2022 = 131 kt

To find the Total waste for 2022:
Total waste = Non-hazardous waste generation - Total recycled waste
Total waste = 223 kt - 131 kt
Total waste = 92 kt

Therefore, the Total waste (kilotons) in the year 2021 is 92 kt.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:34:36.191 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of water recycled in the year 2021, we need to look for a row in the table that specifically mentions water recycling. In this table, the row that comes closest to water recycling is "Desalinated water (thousand cubic meters)." However, desalinated water is not the same as recycled water. Desalinated water refers to the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it suitable for consumption, whereas recycled water is treated wastewater that can be reused for various purposes.

Since the table does not contain a specific row for recycled water, we cannot determine the amount of water recycled in the year 2021 from this table.

This value represents the total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent for that year. Since CO2 and CO are related in terms of carbon-based emissions, it is possible that the CO2 equivalent value includes CO emissions as well.

Therefore, the answer to the question about the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021 can potentially be found in the Total greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) row for that year. However, without further clarification or specific data on CO emissions separately, we cannot definitively confirm if this value includes CO emissions.

Conclusion: Maybe

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:37:44.659 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021, we need to look at the provided markdown table. 

The table contains two rows: one for "Occupational safety and HSI programme" with a value of 12, and another for "Occupational health" with a value of 13. 

Since the question specifically asks for the average number of hours of training, we need to calculate the average of these two values. 

(12 + 13) / 2 = 25 / 2 = 12.5

Therefore, the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021 is 12.5 hours.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:38:09.266 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021, we need to look for specific information related to anti-corruption training in the markdown table provided.

1. Look for any mention of training hours specifically related to anti-corruption issues.
2. Identify if there is any data on the number of employees who received this training.
3. Calculate the average number of hours of training per employee based on the information found.

After carefully examining the markdown table, we can see that there is a section under "ANTI-BRIBERY, ANTI-TRUST AND COMPETITION LAW" that mentions the training provided by Sasol. It states that Sasol rolled out four separate compliance training modules in FY23, including competition law, anti-bribery, sanctions, and business and human rights. However, there is no specific mention of the number of hours dedicated to anti-corruption training or the number of employees who received this training.

Without specific data on the number of hours of anti-corruption training or the number of employees who received this training, we cannot calculate the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 based on the information provided in the markdown table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

2024-03-09 15:38:22.157 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to look at the "B-BBEE (RSA only)" row in the table. Specifically, we are interested in the value under the "2021 - Rm" column for this row.

Since the question is asking for the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021, we would also need to consider the total spend for 2021. However, the table provided does not have a specific row or column that directly provides the total spend for 2021. Without this information, we cannot calculate the percentage as requested.

In this table, the columns represent different years, and the rows seem to be related to different aspects of the company such as Employee turnover and Safety.

Since the question is about the Board meeting attendance rate, which is not explicitly mentioned in the table, we cannot directly determine the answer from this table. The table seems to focus on Human Capital metrics and Safety, not Board meeting attendance.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown table, the answer is 'no'.
