Answer:

2024-03-09 18:22:59.267 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The specific question asks for the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021. However, the table provided only includes data for the years 2022 and 2023. Since there is no information given for the year 2021 in the table, the Hazardous waste (kilotons) in the year 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Are you sure that '526.2' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Social investment (SI) spend - South Africa in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '407744.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total energy use (thousand gigajoules) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Explanation:
The table provides information on employee numbers for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, but it only explicitly mentions the number of permanent employees for each year. The number of non-permanent employees in 2021 is not directly provided in the table.

Explanation:
The table provided only shows data for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 regarding the "Natural Capital - Our environment" in terms of hectares for ENERGY. It does not specify the land used for mining in the year 2021. The table does not contain any information about the specific land used for mining in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Land used for mining (hectare) in the year 2021?" cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

2024-03-09 18:30:49.430 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No, the duration of strikes and lockouts in the year 2021 cannot be found in the provided markdown table. The table only contains information about Sasol Mining renewing its water use licenses and facing challenges in the process. There is no mention of strikes or lockouts, let alone their duration in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the specific question is not directly retrievable from the context.
