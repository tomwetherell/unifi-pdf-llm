Are you sure that '99.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:56.343 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance in 2021 is 99%.
- Therefore, '99.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

For the second table:
- The Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance in 2021 is also 99%.
- Therefore, '99.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table as well.

For the third table:
- The Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance in 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the first two tables, '99.0' is the correct answer to the question for those tables. However, for the third table, the value for 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:59.068 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 16.63 GJ/t.

For the second table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated, as the value for 2021 is missing.

For the third table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 16.63 GJ/t.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is indeed 16.63 GJ/t.

Are you sure that '505575.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Carbon emissions – Scope 1 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:53:04.511 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Carbon emissions - Scope 1 for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of 505575 is for the year 2020, not 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the Total scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of 557114 is for the year 2021, but it represents the total of scope 1 and 2 emissions, not just scope 1 emissions.

Considering the information provided in the tables, it cannot be confirmed that '505575.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Carbon emissions – Scope 1 in the year 2021?".

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:53:57.469 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies for the year 2021 is indeed 33097440.

Looking at the second table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 for investments in projects to improve waste efficiency. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies for the year 2021 is 18140418.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies in the year 2021?" is **18140418** based on the information provided in the tables.

Are you sure that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:54:00.000 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in the row related to employee training spend. The value "66986" is mentioned under the "TRAINING HOURS" category, which does not directly correspond to the employee training spend for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, I cannot confirm that "66986.0" is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021?"

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:54:17.210 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

The table does not provide a specific value for the total number of training hours in the year 2021. It only mentions the training hours for the year 2020 (66986). Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of training hours in 2021 from this table.

For the second markdown table:

Similarly, this table does not provide a specific value for the total number of training hours in the year 2021. It mentions the training hours for the year 2020 (9 331), but does not provide a value for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of training hours in 2021 from this table.

For the third markdown table:

The table explicitly states the number of employees trained for each year, including internal and external training interventions. For the year 2021, the number of employees trained is 8760. However, this table does not directly provide the total number of training hours for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot definitively determine the total number of training hours in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:54:25.678 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row "Number of employees (full time equivalent)" shows a value of 37357, not 32949. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees (full time equivalent) in the year 2021?" is **37357**.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no explicit row for "Number of employees (full time equivalent)" provided, so we cannot determine the exact value from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the row "Number of employees (full time equivalent)" shows a value of 32949, which is different from the value in the first table. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is **37357** as per the first table.

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of registered patents in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:54:32.401 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is stated as '2'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of registered patents in the year 2021?" is '2', not '2.0'.

Looking at the second table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is also stated as '2'. Therefore, the correct answer remains '2'.

Looking at the third table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the Number of registered trademarks and Number of domains for each year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of registered patents in the year 2021?" is '2', and not '2.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:14.472 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - The row for Executive Board members is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The last available data is for the year 2019, which shows 5 members.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of Executive Board members for 2021 from this table.

2. In the second table:
   - The row for Board members shows 10 members for the year 2021.
   - The row for Non-executive Board members shows 7 members for the year 2021.
   - Since the table does not explicitly state the number of Executive Board members, we cannot determine the exact count for 2021.

3. In the third table:
   - The row for Executive Board members shows 3 members for the year 2021.
   - The row for Prescribed officers does not have any data provided for any year.
   - Therefore, we can conclude that there were 3 Executive Board members in 2021 based on this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021?" is '3', as indicated in the third table.

Are you sure that '505575.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:27.651 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the carbon emissions for CO in the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The only value given in the table is for carbon emissions - Scope 1, which is measured in tCO2-e. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of CO specifically for the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:32.604 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row for "Petrol used by contractor equipment" shows a value of 2 for carbon emissions. This row does not directly mention volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so we cannot definitively say that the emissions of VOCs in the year 2021 were 2.0 based on this table alone.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for that year.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '122433239.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:40.335 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the amount of Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in the year 2021 is 122,433,239. This value matches the given answer of '122433239.0'.

For the second table, the amount of Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot confirm if '122433239.0' is the correct answer for this table.

For the third table, the percentage of management (top and senior) who are women in the year 2021 is 28.2%. There is no information related to assets under management by asset class employing social issues in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can only confirm that '122433239.0' is the correct answer for the first table. For the other tables, the answer is not explicitly stated.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:46.229 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the number of environmental fines and/or non-compliances, which is 3 for 2021.

In the second table, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The table only shows the number of environmental fines and/or non-compliances, which is 3 for 2021.

In the third table, there is no information related to fines paid or payable due to settlements. The table provides details about employees, warnings issued, dismissals, appeals lodged, and cases in progress, but not about fines.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:55:50.223 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021: 297,050 tons

2. Table 2:
   - Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021: 297,050 tons

3. Table 3:
   - Non-hazardous waste efficiency - non-hazardous waste sent to landfill per ton of sugar produced in 2021: 3.975 kg/t

Based on the information provided in the tables, there is no explicit mention of the "Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered" specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine if 297,050 tons is the correct answer to the question based on the given tables.

The closest information we have is about land abandoned, which is not the same as forestland restoration or rehabilitation.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no mention of forestland restoration or rehabilitation for the year 2021. The rows provided are about land not under cane and land abandoned, which do not directly relate to forestland restoration.

Finally, in the third table, we see information about ElA approved land and land under cane but not irrigated. There is no specific mention of forestland restoration or rehabilitation for the year 2021 in this table either.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated in the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No

The value '66986' is provided, but it is not explicitly stated that this is for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the average hours of training in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value '(2020: 9 331)' is mentioned, indicating that this value is for the year 2020. There is no explicit mention of the training hours for 2021 in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine the average hours of training in 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, the value '(2020: 656)' is provided, specifying that this value is for the year 2020. There is also a mention of "EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING" without a specific value for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the average hours of training in 2021 from this table.

1. Table 1:
   - The row for the year 2020 states the number of employees (9,331) but does not mention the training hours.
   - The row for the year 2021 mentions training hours (not specified) but does not mention the number of employees.
   - Conclusion: The average number of hours of training for full-time employees in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

2. Table 2:
   - The row for the year 2020 does not mention training hours.
   - The row for the year 2021 mentions the training hours as 66,986 but does not mention the number of employees.
   - Conclusion: The average number of hours of training for full-time employees in 2021 is explicitly provided as 66,986 in this table.

3. Table 3:
   - The row for the year 2020 mentions the number of employees (656) but does not mention the training hours.
   - The row for the year 2021 does not mention either the number of employees or the training hours.
   - Conclusion: The average number of hours of training for full-time employees in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

Based on the analysis of each table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average number hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:11.564 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no specific mention of the year 2021. The only information provided is the number 66986 under "TRAINING HOURS." This value does not specify that it is for the year 2021, so we cannot conclude that it represents the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in 2021.

2. In the second table, there is a mention of the year 2020 in parentheses next to the number 9331 under "EMPLOYEES." The phrase "TRAINING HOURS" is listed below. This table does not provide information about the year 2021, so we cannot determine the average number of training hours for that year.

3. In the third table, there is a mention of the year 2020 in parentheses next to the number 656 under "EMPLOYEES." The phrase "EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING" is listed below. This table also does not provide information about the year 2021, so we cannot conclude the average number of training hours for that year.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, none of them explicitly state the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:15.325 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the number of training hours in the year 2021. The value "(2020: 9 331)" is mentioned, but there is no direct mention of the training hours for 2021.

In the second table, the value "66986" is mentioned under the column "TRAINING HOURS." This value is not explicitly linked to the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021 based on this table alone.

In the third table, the value "(2020: 656)" is provided, but again, there is no direct mention of the training hours for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:20.144 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the number '66986' is listed under the column 'TRAINING HOURS', but there is no specific mention of the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine if this value corresponds to the year in question.

In the second table, the number '66986' is explicitly listed under the column 'TRAINING HOURS', which suggests that this value is indeed the number of training hours for the year 2021.

In the third table, the number '656' is listed under the column 'EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING', but there is no specific mention of the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can conclude that the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '66986.0'.

Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:24.421 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row related to B-BBEE Level does not provide the specific information about the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend. The table only shows the B-BBEE Level for each year, not the procurement spend percentage.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table for the year 2021, we cannot determine that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in that year.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:29.276 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the total number of Board members is 10. There is no specific breakdown provided for Board members between the ages of 30-50 in this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we see that there are 7 Independent Board members. Again, there is no specific breakdown provided for Board members between the ages of 30-50 in this table.

Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, the average age of directors is 54. While this gives us an idea of the overall age distribution, it does not provide a direct count of Board members between the ages of 30-50.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact number of Board members between 30-50 in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:32.722 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row for "Average age of directors" shows a value of 54. This indicates that the average age of directors in 2021 is 54. Since the question is about the number of Board members over 50 in 2021, we cannot directly determine this from the given table. We would need additional information about the distribution of ages among the Board members to accurately answer the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot definitively say that the number of Board members over 50 in 2021 is 4.0.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:38.062 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for South Africa, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The table only includes information on the number of contractors but does not mention the costs associated with them.

In the second table for Mozambique, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are also not explicitly provided. Similar to the first table, the information on the number of contractors is given, but the actual costs are not mentioned.

In the third table for Zimbabwe, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are once again not explicitly provided. The table includes data on the number of contractors but does not specify the associated costs.

Therefore, based on the information presented in the tables, the answer to the question "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '2021.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:56:48.994 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no mention of the year 2021 or a specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in that year. The focus is on initiatives related to environmental responsibility and technology development.

2. In the second table, there is a mention of policies and procedures being significantly improved in FY2021, including the appointment of a group Environmental Compliance Officer. However, this does not provide a specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in 2021.

3. In the third table, there is a mention of the goal to address threats of harm to persons or the environment in a preventive manner. There is also a mention of efficiency targets for environmental performance, but again, no specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '2021.0'. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.
