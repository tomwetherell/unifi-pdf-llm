Are you sure that '1.331' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:46:21.584 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for the year 2021 is indeed provided as 1.331.

Looking at the second table, the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for the year 2021 is also provided as 1.331.

Looking at the third table, the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:46:27.404 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The cell corresponding to the year 2021 under the "B-BBEE Level" row is empty. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '4'. Therefore, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 in this table is indeed '4'.

In the third table, there is no information provided about the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is '4' in the second table, but it is not explicitly stated in the first and third tables.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:46:34.536 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Energy efficiency value for 2021 is explicitly given as 16.63 GJ/t.

For the second table:
- The Energy efficiency value for 2021 is explicitly given as 16.63 GJ/t.

For the third table:
- The Energy efficiency value for 2021 is not explicitly given, but the target value for 2025 is provided as 15.92 GJ/t based on 2021 being the new base year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Energy efficiency value for 2021 is indeed 16.63 GJ/t.

2024-03-04 21:46:40.227 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. Therefore, we cannot determine the FIFR for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 0.005. Therefore, the FIFR for 2021 in this table is indeed 0.005.

Looking at the third table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. Therefore, we cannot determine the FIFR for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:46:59.245 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 41. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021?" is indeed 41.

Looking at the second table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 41. Therefore, the correct answer remains 41.

Looking at the third table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The value for 2021 is missing in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021?" is 41 for the first two tables, but it is not explicitly stated in the third table.

Are you sure that '97.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:47:32.803 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 97.7%.

In the second table, the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 97.7%.

In the third table, the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. However, the Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) is given for the year 2021 as 297050 tons.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is indeed 97.7%.

Yes.

Are you sure that '23822054.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:47:52.051 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value of employee training spend in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 23822054. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021?" is '23822054'.

Looking at the second table, the value of employee training spend in the year 2021 is also explicitly provided as 23822054. Therefore, the correct answer remains '23822054'.

In the third table, there is no explicit mention of the value of employee training spend for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the value from this table.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is '23822054'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 35721923.0 Rands in rand?

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:48:10.056 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The table does not provide the Total number of training hours for any specific year, including 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total number of training hours in 2021 from this table.

For the second table:

The table explicitly states that the Total number of training hours is 66986. This value corresponds to the year 2021. Therefore, the Total number of training hours in the year 2021 is indeed 66986.

For the third table:

The table provides the Total number of training hours for each year, including 2021. The Total number of training hours in 2021 is explicitly stated as 66986.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total number of training hours in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is '66986.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:48:25.314 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Number of registered patents for the year 2021 is given as '2'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of registered patents in the year 2021?" is '2', not '2.0'.

In the second table, the Number of registered patents for the year 2021 is also given as '2'. Therefore, the correct answer remains '2'.

In the third table, the Number of registered patents for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided in the first two tables, we can conclude that the correct answer is '2'.

So, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of registered patents in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in all three tables is '2', not '2.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:48:29.278 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for "Water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/ or overflows) - total" in the year 2021 is 72,721,647 m3.

Looking at the second table, the value for "Water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/ or overflows) - total" in the year 2021 is also 72,721,647 m3.

Looking at the third table, the value for "Water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/or overflows) - agricultural" in the year 2021 is 66,993,353 m3, not the total water discharged.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Are you sure that '20.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Employee turnover – South Africa in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:49:04.484 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the number of Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 10, not 10.0. Therefore, '10.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

Looking at the second table, the number of Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 10, not 10.0. Therefore, '10.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

Looking at the third table, the number of Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 10, not 10.0. Therefore, '10.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members in the year 2021?" is 10, not 10.0.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:49:27.800 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is 3. This value is explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table.

Looking at the second table, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is also 3. This value is explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table.

Looking at the third table, there is no specific information provided about fines paid or payable due to settlements for the year 2021. The table only includes data on rates for different years.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" is '3.0' for the first two tables, and there is no explicit information in the third table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 3.0 number in rand?

Are you sure that '99.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:49:37.086 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for 2020, 2019, and 2018 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in 2021 was 99.0%.

For the second table:
- The Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 99%.
- Therefore, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in 2021 is indeed 99.0% according to the second table.

For the third table:
- The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for 2020, 2019, and 2018 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in 2021 was 99.0%.

The value '66986' is provided under the column 'TRAINING HOURS' but it is not explicitly stated that this corresponds to health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in 2021.

In the second table, the value '(2020: 9 331)' is provided under the column 'EMPLOYEES' but it is not clear if this is related to the number of hours of training for health, safety, and emergency response in 2021.

Answer:

There is no specific mention of contract employees in this table, so we cannot determine the average number of hours of training for contract employees in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the row related to the year 2021 provides the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors, but it does not mention the average number of hours of training for contract employees.

Are you sure that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:49:51.079 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table, the value provided for the year 2021 in the row "Total number of training hours" is 66986. This value represents the total number of training hours for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second markdown table, the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The value of 66986 represents the total number of training hours for the year 2021, not the average.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:49:56.497 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the training hours in the year 2021. The table only mentions the number of employees in 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value of 66986 training hours is provided, but it is not specified for which year these training hours are relevant. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, the value of 8760 employees attending training is provided, but again, it is not explicitly stated for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine if 8760.0 is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '20.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Black female exec. directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:02.837 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that the percentage of female Board members is provided as 20%. However, the specific information about Black female executive directors is not explicitly stated in this table for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table alone, we cannot determine the exact percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the average age of directors is given for the year 2021 as 54, and the overall Board and Committee meeting attendance is provided as 99%. Again, there is no specific mention of Black female executive directors in this table for the year 2021.

In the third table, the average length of full Board service and the average age of directors are provided for the year 2021, but there is no information about Black female executive directors.

Therefore, based on the information presented in the markdown tables provided, we cannot determine the exact percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:05.909 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the number of Independent Board members is 7. In the second table for the year 2021, the number of Female Board members is 2. In the third table for the year 2021, the number of HDSA1 Board members is 4.

Adding these numbers together: 7 (Independent) + 2 (Female) + 4 (HDSA1) = 13

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021?" is not 2.0.

Are you sure that '4408.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:11.669 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the first table. The row that corresponds to the year 2021 and provides information on the number of contractor (vendors) employees (full-time equivalent) is:

| Number of contractor (vendors) employees (full time equivalent*) | number | 4408 | 3662 | 3532 | 3463 |

From this row, we can see that the number of contractor employees in 2021 is 4408. However, this table does not provide direct information on the Contractor costs per income statement. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that '4408.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '16.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:24.566 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. Table 1:
   - The table does not provide information about the year 2021.
   - The only information provided is about work-related fatalities, which is not directly related to the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks.

2. Table 2:
   - The table does not provide information about the year 2021.
   - The only information provided is about the number of employees in 2020, which is not related to the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks.

3. Table 3:
   - The table mentions "change risks (in order of determined materiality)" and "16. Heat stress and other climate-related occupational incidents."
   - This information does not directly address the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, the information related to the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.
