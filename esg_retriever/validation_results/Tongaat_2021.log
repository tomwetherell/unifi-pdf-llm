Answer:

2024-03-09 15:56:21.697 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to calculate the sum of all types of injury frequency rates for that year. In the provided table, we have the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, which is 0.093.

However, the LTIFR alone does not provide the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) as it is just one component of the total. To calculate the TIFR, we would need additional information on other types of injury frequency rates such as Medical Treatment Injury Frequency Rate (MTIFR), Restricted Work Injury Frequency Rate (RWIFR), etc.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Hazardous waste disposed of at appropriate facilities in the year 2021?" is '184'.

Looking at the second table, the hazardous waste disposed of at appropriate facilities is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The values for 2021 in the second table are related to hazardous waste efficiency, not the total amount disposed of.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:57:45.571 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look at the specific row in the table that provides this information. The LTIFR is not directly given in the table, but we can calculate it using the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) and the formula for LTIFR.

The formula for LTIFR is:
LTIFR = (Number of Lost Time Injuries / Total Hours Worked) * 200,000

Given that the LTIFR is the number of LTIs per 200,000 person hours worked, we can calculate it using the TIFR for 2021 and the total hours worked in 2021. Since the TIFR for 2021 is 1.331, we can use this value along with the total hours worked in 2021 to calculate the LTIFR for 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found by performing a calculation based on the information provided in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:57:48.694 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need two pieces of information: the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and the total number of person hours worked by employees and contractors in 2021.

From the provided table, we have the number of days lost due to LTI for employees and contractors in 2021, which is 945. However, this information alone is not sufficient to calculate the LTIFR. We also need the total number of person hours worked by employees and contractors in 2021 to calculate the LTIFR.

Since the table does not provide the total number of person hours worked in 2021, we cannot directly calculate the LTIFR for employees and contractors in 2021 using the information given in the table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

1. The table header mentions "IMPROVING LIVES" and "EMPLOYEES," indicating that the table might contain information related to employees.

2. The number "1240" is listed under the "EMPLOYEES" column, suggesting that this number represents some aspect of employees.

3. The additional information "AS AT 23 JUNE 2021" specifies the date for which the employee count is relevant.

Answer:

The TRIFR is calculated by summing the number of recordable injuries (MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities) and dividing it by the total number of hours worked by employees and contractors.

However, the table provided only gives us the Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, which is not the same as the TRIFR. The TIFR includes all injuries, not just recordable ones.

Therefore, we cannot directly determine the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for employees and contractors in 2021 from the information provided in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:59:20.145 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of female board members in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of female board members out of the total number of board members in 2021. 

From the table, we see that the total number of board members in 2021 is 40% of the HDSA Board members. We also see that there were 2 female board members in 2021.

To calculate the percentage of female board members in 2021, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of female board members} = \left( \frac{\text{Female Board members}}{\text{Total Board members}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of female board members in 2021} = \left( \frac{2}{40} \right) \times 100 = 5\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of female board members in the year 2021 is 5%.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:59:23.914 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 20%. Therefore, '20.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question for this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 20%. So, '20.0' is the correct answer for this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for other years are given, but not for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact Percentage of female Board members for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: 
For the first two tables, '20.0' is the correct answer, but for the third table, we cannot determine the exact value for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:59:29.425 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021, we need to calculate the ratio of the recycled waste to the total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021 and then convert it to a percentage.

1. Calculate the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in 2021:
   - Recycled waste in 2021: 2564 tons
   - Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021: 297050 tons
   - Percentage = (Recycled waste / Total volume of waste recycled) * 100
   - Percentage = (2564 / 297050) * 100 ≈ 0.86%

2. Since the percentage calculated above represents the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021, the answer to the question is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:59:55.145 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to calculate it based on the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) provided in the table. The formula to calculate TRIFR is usually:

TRIFR = (Total Recordable Injuries / Total Hours Worked) x 1,000,000

Since the table only provides the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for each year, we cannot directly determine the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for 2021. We would need additional information such as the total number of recordable injuries and total hours worked in 2021 to calculate the TRIFR.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:59:58.604 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Total Recordable Cases Frequency Rate (TRCFR)" in the table provided. The TRCFR is given as 1.037 for the year 2021. 

The TRCFR is not the same as TRIFR, but they are related. TRIFR typically includes both employees and contractors, while TRCFR may only include employees or a subset of the workforce. 

Given that TRCFR is the closest measure provided in the table to TRIFR, we can infer that the TRIFR for employees and contractors in the year 2021 is 1.037. 

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be found in the table, and it is 1.037.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:00:11.537 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development expenditures for the year 2021 is indeed stated as '122433239'. 

In the second table, the same value of '122433239' is provided for the year 2021 for both Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development and SED expenditures.

In the third table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021, so we cannot confirm the expenditure amount from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '122433239.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in the year 2021?".

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:00:56.869 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total water abstracted in the year 2021, we need to consider the water exported (sold or provided for free) and the water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/or overflows). The total water abstracted would be the sum of these two values.

In the provided table, the water exported (sold or provided for free) - total for 2021 is 7,881,710 m3, and the water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/or overflows) - total for 2021 is 72,721,647 m3.

To find the total water abstracted in 2021, we need to add these two values together:

Total water abstracted = Water exported (sold or provided for free) - total + Water discharged (scheduled and/or non-scheduled effluent and/or overflows) - total
Total water abstracted = 7,881,710 + 72,721,647
Total water abstracted = 80,603,357 m3

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Water abstracted – total in the year 2021?" can be found in the provided markdown table, and the total water abstracted in 2021 is 80,603,357 m3.

In the year 2021, the value under the "2021" column for the "Number of employees trained, including internal and external" row is 8760. This value represents the number of employees trained in 2021, not the total number of employees (full time equivalent) working in the organization.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of employees (full time equivalent) in the year 2021?" cannot be found in this table.

2024-03-09 16:02:19.366 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Cost of ART (R million)" row in the table for the year 2021. In this case, the cost of ART for 2021 is 1.2 R million.

However, the question specifically asks for the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS. The table only provides information on the cost of ART, which is a specific component of HIV/AIDS management. It does not provide a comprehensive view of the overall health spend or the CSI/SED spend related to health and HIV/AIDS.

Therefore, based on the information available in the provided table, we cannot directly determine the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

In this table, the information provided under "KEY SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES" seems to be more relevant to sustainability goals and projects.

Looking at the "KEY SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES" column, we see two objectives listed:
1. Cultivating strategic and preferential procurement
2. Managing water resources and increasing efficiency

The second objective, "Managing water resources and increasing efficiency," specifically mentions improving water efficiency. Therefore, if there were any investments in projects to improve water efficiency in the year 2021, it is likely that they would be mentioned under this objective.

So, based on the information provided in the table, the answer to the question can potentially be found in the second sustainability objective mentioned.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

2024-03-09 16:03:11.956 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Employee turnover for South Africa in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are not permanent as at 31 March. This can be done by subtracting the percentage of permanent employees from 100%.

In 2021, the percentage of permanent employees is 65.5%. Therefore, the percentage of non-permanent employees (which includes turnover) would be 100% - 65.5% = 34.5%.

So, the Employee turnover for South Africa in 2021 would be 34.5%.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:03:29.155 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total carbon emissions – Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021, we need to sum up the Total scope 1 emissions and the Total indirect energy consumption for the year 2021 from the provided table.

Total carbon emissions – Scope 1 and 2 in 2021 = Total scope 1 emissions + Total indirect energy consumption for 2021

From the table:
Total scope 1 emissions in 2021 = 505575
Total indirect energy consumption for 2021 = 51539

Adding these two values:
Total carbon emissions – Scope 1 and 2 in 2021 = 505575 + 51539 = 557114

Therefore, the Total carbon emissions – Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021 is 557114.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:03:49.227 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Executive Board members in the year 2021 from the given table, we need to first understand the distinction between Board members and Non-executive Board members. 

In most organizations, the Executive Board members are typically part of the Board members category. Non-executive Board members are individuals who are not part of the executive management team but serve on the board in a non-executive capacity.

Looking at the table, we see that there are two categories mentioned: Board members and Non-executive Board members. The number of Board members in 2021 is listed as 10, and the number of Non-executive Board members is listed as 7.

Since the table does not explicitly mention the specific count of Executive Board members, we cannot directly determine the number of Executive Board members in the year 2021 from this table alone. The distinction between Executive Board members and other board members is not provided in this table.

Therefore, based on the information available in the given markdown table, we cannot determine the Executive Board members in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:03:51.025 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Executive Board members in the year 2021, we need to look at the row where the unit of measure is "Executive Board members" and then check the value under the column for the year 2021.

In this table, the row for Executive Board members has the unit of measure as "number." Looking at the column for the year 2021, we see that the value is 3. This means that there were 3 Executive Board members in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021?" can be found in this markdown table.

Consider the following markdown tables:

| Prescribed officers     |                   |        |        |        |        |

Are you sure that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:03:53.253 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, we can see that the value for Executive Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '3'. There is no indication that this value is not accurate or that it should be '3.0'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021?" is '3', not '3.0'.

So, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:04:12.187 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021, we need to look for the row that corresponds to CO emissions and the column that corresponds to the year 2021.

In the given table, the closest information we have is under "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" which might include CO emissions. The unit of measure is given as tCO2e, which stands for metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. While this is not exactly the same as CO emissions, it is a common unit used to express the global warming potential of various greenhouse gases, including CO.

The value under the year 2021 for "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" is 505,575 tCO2e. This value likely includes CO emissions along with other greenhouse gases. Therefore, we can infer that the CO emissions in the year 2021 are 505,575 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

So, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021?" can be found in the given markdown table.

2024-03-09 16:05:28.491 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to analyze the information given. 

The table includes data on environmental compliance, specifically on environmental fines and/or non-compliances. The unit of measure for this data is in numbers, indicating the count of fines or non-compliances.

However, the table does not provide the actual monetary amounts of the fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021. It only shows the number of fines or non-compliances for each year from 2018 to 2021.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:05:36.600 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total volume of waste recycled in 2021 and then find the percentage of waste that is sent for recycling.

1. Total volume of waste recycled in 2021: 297,050 tons
2. Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling in 2021: 97.7%

To calculate the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in 2021, we can use the formula:

Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) = Total volume of waste recycled * (Percentage of waste sent for recycling / 100)

Substitute the values:

Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) = 297,050 * (97.7 / 100) = 290,159.85 tonnes

Therefore, the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 is approximately 290,159.85 tonnes.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:06:07.436 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific row or category in the table that corresponds to forestland restoration or rehabilitation. In this table, the closest categories related to land restoration are "Land not under cane - fallow" and "Land abandoned (no longer under cane)." 

The "Land not under cane - fallow" category may represent land that is not currently being used for agriculture and could potentially be restored or rehabilitated. In 2021, 2847 hectares of such land were recorded.

Similarly, the "Land abandoned (no longer under cane)" category suggests land that was previously used for agriculture but has been abandoned and could also be a candidate for restoration or rehabilitation. In 2021, 4475 hectares of such land were recorded.

Therefore, the sum of 2847 hectares and 4475 hectares from these two categories (Land not under cane - fallow and Land abandoned) could potentially represent the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

Looking at the table, we see that the Independent Board members in 2021 were 7. However, we do not have specific information on the age range of these Independent Board members. The table does not provide a breakdown of the age groups within the Independent Board members category.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:07:41.160 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine the number of Board members between the ages of 30 and 50 in the year 2021, we need to calculate the range of ages that fall within this category. 

Given that the average age of directors in 2021 is 54, we can infer that there are Board members both younger and older than this average age. However, without specific data on the distribution of ages or the number of Board members, we cannot definitively state the exact count of Board members between 30 and 50 in 2021 based on the provided table alone.

In the table provided, the average age of directors in 2021 is 54. This means that, on average, the directors in 2021 are 54 years old.

However, this information alone does not directly tell us the exact number of Board members who are over 50 in 2021. It only gives us the average age of all directors.

2024-03-09 16:07:58.692 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific cost related to contractors in the table. In this table, the columns related to contractors are "FIXED TERM CONTRACTORS - Female", "FIXED TERM CONTRACTORS - Male", and "FIXED TERM CONTRACTORS - Total". These columns provide information about the number of fixed-term contractors by gender.

However, the table does not directly provide the costs associated with these contractors. The table mainly focuses on the number of employees by type and gender in different countries. To determine the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021, we would need additional financial information or a different table that explicitly states the costs related to contractors.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:09:34.731 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the answer to the question can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to look at the information related to the management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021.

In the table, the safety measures mentioned are Lost time injuries (LTI) and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). These measures provide insights into the accidents and safety risks within the organization.

From the data in the table, we can see that in the year 2021, the number of Lost time injuries (LTI) decreased to 36 from 42 in 2020 and 2019. This reduction indicates an improvement in managing accident risks in 2021.

Additionally, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) decreased to 0.093 in 2021 from 0.107 in 2020 and 0.087 in 2019. A decrease in LTIFR signifies a better safety performance in terms of long-term health and safety risks.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we can conclude that the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 can be found in the markdown table.

1. **Stakeholder priorities**: The table outlines the stakeholder priorities related to risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests. This section provides insights into the concerns and focus areas of stakeholders regarding community relationships and support.

2. **Our response**: The table also presents the company's response to the identified risks and opportunities. It highlights the actions or strategies that the company plans to implement to address the stakeholder priorities and manage the associated risks and opportunities.

3. **Discussion of process**: While the table provides a general overview of stakeholder priorities and the company's response, it does not explicitly detail the discussion of the process to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests in the year 2021. The information presented is more focused on identifying risks and opportunities and outlining the company's approach to addressing them.

Based on the information provided in the markdown table, the detailed discussion of the process to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned. The table primarily highlights stakeholder concerns, company responses, risks, and opportunities without delving into the specific processes or strategies discussed in the context of managing community rights and interests.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the given markdown table.
