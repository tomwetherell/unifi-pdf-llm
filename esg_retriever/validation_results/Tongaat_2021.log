Are you sure that '60204.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total – company managed/farmed land (owned and leased) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:41:46.182 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total - company managed/farmed land (owned and leased) for the year 2021 is given as 52883 hectares.

In the second table, the Total - company managed/farmed land (owned and leased) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. However, the value for 2021 in the previous table is 52883 hectares, and the trend seems to be increasing over the years. Therefore, it is unlikely that the correct answer is 60204 hectares for 2021 in this table.

In the third table, the Total - company managed/farmed land (owned and leased) for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 60204 hectares.

Considering each table individually and the information provided, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total – company managed/farmed land (owned and leased) in the year 2021?" is '60204' hectares based on the third table.

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

The specific question asks for the energy efficiency in terms of total direct and indirect energy consumed per ton of sugar produced in the year 2021. The table provides the values for this metric for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. The value for 2021 is explicitly given as 16.63 GJ/t. Therefore, the answer to the question is directly retrievable from the context.

Conclusion: Yes.

The specific question asks for the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021. However, the table provided only includes the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors. The TRIFR is a specific metric that includes only recordable injuries, while the TIFR may include non-recordable injuries as well. Since the table does not provide the TRIFR specifically, the answer to the question is not directly retrievable from the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

The total direct energy consumption in 2021 is 26,552,564 GJ.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021:

| Total indirect energy consumption from net electricity consumed | GJ                |   560466 |  1385479 |   893034 |   917603 |

The total indirect energy consumption in 2021 is 560,466 GJ.

Adding the total direct and indirect energy consumption for 2021:

26,552,564 GJ (direct) + 560,466 GJ (indirect) = 27,113,030 GJ

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total direct and indirect energy consumption in the year 2021?" is 27,113,030 GJ.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:45:21.907 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The specific question asks for the number of contractor (vendors) employees in the year 2021. The table provided does not have a separate breakdown for the number of contractor employees specifically. It only provides the total number of employees and contractors (full-time equivalent) for each year. Without a specific breakdown for contractor employees, the exact number of contractor employees in 2021 cannot be determined from the given table.

Therefore, the answer is no.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:46:59.884 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value provided for "Board members" is 10. There is no indication that this value is not for the year 2021, so we can conclude that the Board members in the year 2021 is indeed 10.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no value provided for "Board members" in that specific year. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of Board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members in the year 2021?" is '10.0' according to the first table, and 'N/A' according to the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:47:50.001 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The specific question asks for the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021. The provided markdown table does not contain any information related to the amount of assets under management or asset classes. It only provides information about public disclosures on board member conflicts of interest and board member PEP. Since there is no mention of assets under management or asset classes in the table, the answer to the specific question cannot be found in the given context.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:50:54.112 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021. In the provided markdown table, there are two principles related to the environment mentioned, but neither of them directly provides the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021. 

The first principle talks about supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, emphasizing the prevention of risks. The second principle discusses initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, including efficiency targets for environmental performance. However, these principles do not detail the specific environmental management policies and practices implemented at active sites in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the specific question is 'no' as the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
