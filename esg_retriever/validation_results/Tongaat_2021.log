Answer:

2024-03-06 23:38:54.189 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 16.63 GJ/t.

For the second table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 16.63 GJ/t.

For the third table:
The Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is not explicitly given, but the target value for 2025 is provided as 15.92 GJ/t based on 2021 being the new base year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Energy efficiency value for the year 2021 is indeed 16.63 GJ/t.

Looking at the second table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 0.005. Therefore, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 in this table is indeed 0.005.

Looking at the third table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. Therefore, we cannot determine the FIFR for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR, i.e. number of fatalities per 200 000 person hours worked) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" based on the provided tables is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:39:18.608 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 41, not 41.0. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021?" is 41, not 41.0.

Looking at the second table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 41, not 41.0. Therefore, the correct answer remains 41.

Moving on to the third table, the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot confirm the value for this specific year from this table.

Conclusion: The correct answer to the question "What was the Number of employees with disabilities in the year 2021?" based on the provided tables is 41, not 41.0.

Are you sure that '97.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:39:46.530 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is indeed 97.7%.

In the second table, the percentage for 2021 is also 97.7%.

In the third table, the percentage for 2021 is not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the exact value for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '23822054.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:40:03.173 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value of employee training spend in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 23822054. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021?" is '23822054.0'.

Looking at the second table, the value of employee training spend in the year 2021 is also explicitly provided as 23822054. Therefore, the correct answer remains '23822054.0'.

In the third table, there is no explicit mention of the value of employee training spend for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the value from this table.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is '23822054.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '77701632.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of person hours worked – employees and contractors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

The value '77701632' corresponds to the total number of person hours worked - employees and contractors in 2021, not just the employees. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that '77701632' is the correct answer to the question.

Considering each table individually, the correct answer is 'No'.

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:40:35.100 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '2'. Therefore, '2.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

Looking at the second table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as '2'. Therefore, '2.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table as well.

Looking at the third table, the Number of registered patents in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The only information provided is for the Number of registered trademarks in 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of registered patents for 2021 from this table.

So, the correct answer is 'yes' for the first two tables and 'no' for the third table.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:40:41.363 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 99893760 Rands.

Looking at the second table, the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 99893760 Rands.

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021?" is '99893760.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '10.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:41:10.120 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the number of Board members is explicitly stated as 10. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members in the year 2021?" is '10'. 

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the number of Board members is not explicitly stated, but the number of Independent Board members is given as 7. Since the total number of Board members is 10, we can infer that the number of Board members in 2021 is also 10.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the number of Board members is explicitly stated as 10.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members in the year 2021?" based on the provided tables is '10.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '294486.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:41:38.620 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021: 297,050 tons
   - Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in 2021: 97.7%

2. Table 2:
   - Recycled waste - other in 2021: 2,564 tons
   - Total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021: 297,050 tons

3. Table 3:
   - Percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in 2021: 97.7%
   - Target percentage for 2025: 100%

Based on the provided tables, there is no explicit mention of the "Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered" specifically for the year 2021. The tables provide information on the total volume of waste recycled, percentage of waste sent for recycling, and other recycled waste, but not specifically for food waste recovered in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021?" cannot be determined from the given tables.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:41:44.473 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values provided are for Overall Board and Committee meeting attendance, not specifically for the Audit committee. Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table.

For the second table:
The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 99%. Therefore, '99.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?".

For the third table:
The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values provided are for Length of current auditor's service and Independence of Board Chairman, not for the Audit committee meeting attendance. Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:41:47.991 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for training hours in 2020 is given as 9,331, not for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the average hours of training in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value for training hours in 2021 is explicitly given as 66,986. This means that the average hours of training in 2021 can be calculated from this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" based on the second table is '66,986'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:41:54.635 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, we see that the number '66986' is listed under the column 'TRAINING HOURS'. However, the table does not specify whether this value corresponds to contract employees or all employees. Since the question specifically asks for the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021, we cannot definitively conclude that '66986.0' is the correct answer based on the information provided in this table.

Moving on to the second table, we find information related to the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors. This table does not provide any data related to training hours for contract employees in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot use this table to determine the average number of training hours for contract employees in 2021.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the two tables, we cannot confirm whether '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:42:01.422 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the training hours in the year 2021. The table only mentions the number of employees in 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value provided for training hours is 66986, but it is not specified for which year this value corresponds to. Without a clear indication that this value is for the year 2021, we cannot conclusively determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the value provided is 8760 employees attending training, which is not directly related to the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '20.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Black female exec. directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:42:08.296 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that the percentage of female Board members is provided as 20%. However, the specific information about Black female executive directors is not explicitly stated in this table. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table alone, we cannot determine the exact percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we see that the average age of directors and the overall Board and Committee meeting attendance are provided, but there is no specific mention of Black female executive directors. Therefore, we cannot find the answer in this table either.

Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, we see the average length of full Board service and the average age of directors, but again, there is no information about Black female executive directors.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot determine the exact percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '4408.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:42:18.845 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the first table. The row that corresponds to the year 2021 and provides information on the number of contractor (vendors) employees (full-time equivalent) is:

| Number of contractor (vendors) employees (full time equivalent*) | number | 4408 | 3662 | 3532 | 3463 |

The value for the year 2021 is 4408, which represents the number of contractor employees. However, this table does not provide direct information on the Contractor costs per income statement. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that '4408.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021.
