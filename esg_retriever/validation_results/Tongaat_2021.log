Answer:

2024-03-10 18:59:53.586 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors, which is the number of LTIs per 200,000 person hours worked.

The LTIFR provided in the table is specific to both employees and contractors, which means it covers the total injury frequency rate for both groups. The LTIFR for the year 2021 is given as 0.093.

Since the LTIFR includes both employees and contractors and represents the frequency of lost time injuries, it can be considered as a measure of the total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

The table includes indicators related to electricity efficiency, specifically electricity consumed per ton of sugar produced.

The indicator provided in the table is "Electricity efficiency: electricity consumed per ton of sugar produced," which specifically focuses on electricity consumption. It does not directly provide information on the total direct and indirect energy consumed per ton of sugar produced, which would include other forms of energy besides electricity.

Since the table only presents data on electricity consumption efficiency and does not cover total direct and indirect energy consumption, we cannot directly retrieve the information needed to answer the question about total energy efficiency in the year 2021.

2024-03-10 19:00:42.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" and "LTIFR target - employees and contractors by 2025."

The "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" provides a combined rate for all injuries, including fatalities, per 200,000 person hours worked. However, it does not specifically break down the number of fatalities within this rate. Without a separate indicator for the number of fatalities, we cannot determine the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 19:00:46.119 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), which is not the same as the FIFR.

The LTIFR measures the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) per 200,000 person hours worked, while the FIFR measures the number of fatalities per 200,000 person hours worked. These are distinct metrics, and the LTIFR cannot be directly used to determine the FIFR.

Since the table does not provide the specific data for the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for employees and contractors in 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The "Total scope 1 and 2 emissions" indicator provides the combined emissions for both Scope 1 and Scope 2. However, it does not break down the total emissions into separate values for Scope 1 and Scope 2.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:01:07.311 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon emissions – Scope 2 in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific value related to Scope 2 emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on "Total scope 1 emissions" and "Total indirect energy consumption: net electricity purchased - all countries." There is no direct mention of Scope 2 emissions in the table.

Scope 2 emissions typically refer to indirect emissions associated with the generation of purchased electricity, heat, or steam. While the table provides information on indirect energy consumption related to net electricity purchased, it does not specifically label this as Scope 2 emissions.

Without a clear indication of Scope 2 emissions in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the value for Carbon emissions – Scope 2 in the year 2021 from the context.

The "LTIFR target - employees and contractors by 2025" indicator mentions a target LTIFR for employees and contractors by 2025, but it does not provide the actual LTIFR values for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:01:30.700 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we typically need two pieces of information: the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and the total number of hours worked by employees and contractors in that year. 

In the provided markdown table, we have the "Days lost due to LTI - employees and contractors" which gives us the number of days lost due to LTIs. However, this information alone is not sufficient to calculate the LTIFR. We also need the total number of hours worked by employees and contractors in 2021 to calculate the LTIFR.

Since the table does not provide the total number of hours worked by employees and contractors in 2021, we cannot directly determine the LTIFR for that year from the given context.

Answer:

The table includes the indicator "Days lost due to LTI - employees and contractors," which provides the number of days lost due to LTIs for both employees and contractors in 2021.

However, the table does not directly provide the total number of LTIs for employees and contractors in 2021. It only gives the number of days lost due to LTIs. This information alone does not allow us to determine the exact number of LTIs that occurred in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Lost time injuries (LTIs, i.e. injuries on duty leading to at least one lost day) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 19:02:41.797 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators for "Days lost due to LTI - employees and contractors" but does not explicitly provide the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities.

The indicator "Days lost due to LTI - employees and contractors" provides information on the number of days lost due to Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for both employees and contractors. While this gives insight into the severity of injuries, it does not directly give the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for the specified groups in 2021.

Without a specific indicator that directly provides the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for employees and contractors in 2021, we cannot retrieve this information directly from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:02:45.233 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" and "LTIFR target - employees and contractors by 2025."

The "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR)" provides a rate of injuries but does not give the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities. It indicates the frequency of injuries relative to the total workforce but does not provide the exact number of injuries.

Since the table does not directly provide the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for employees and contractors in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Total number of recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:03:24.311 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of recycled waste (or reused) waste out of the total volume of waste recycled (or reused) in 2021. 

In the provided markdown table, we have the following relevant information:
- Recycled waste - other: 2564 tons in 2021
- Total volume of waste recycled (or reused): 297050 tons in 2021

To calculate the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in 2021, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Recycled waste - other}}{\text{Total volume of waste recycled (or reused)}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2564}{297050} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.86\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of waste disposed of that is sent for recycling (or reuse) in the year 2021 is approximately 0.86%.

Conclusion: Yes

The table includes indicators such as "Percentage of management (top and senior) who are women (SA only)" and "Percentage of employees who are deemed HDSA1 (SA only)."

The indicator "Percentage of management (top and senior) who are women (SA only)" specifically refers to the percentage of women in management roles, not the overall percentage of female employees. Therefore, this indicator does not provide the information needed to determine the percentage of all employees who are women in 2021.

Since there is no specific indicator in the table that directly states the percentage of all employees who are women in 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage of employees who are women (SA only) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR)" and "Total Recordable Cases Frequency Rate (TRCFR)."

The TRCFR (Total Recordable Cases Frequency Rate) mentioned in the table is not the same as TRIFR (Total recordable injury frequency rate). While TRCFR includes all recordable cases, TRIFR specifically focuses on injuries. The TRIFR may include only a subset of the total recordable cases, which could be injuries or a specific type of injury.

Since the table does not provide a direct value for TRIFR or specify the TRIFR for employees and contractors separately in the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for employees and contractors in 2021 from the given context.

The table includes indicators such as "CSI/SED spend as a percentage of net profit after tax" and "Percentage of total CSI/SED spend in South Africa."

The indicator "CSI/SED spend as a percentage of net profit after tax" provides information on the percentage of spend relative to net profit after tax, but it does not give the actual expenditure amount in monetary terms for the year 2021. Similarly, the "Percentage of total CSI/SED spend in South Africa" indicator only provides a percentage figure related to the total spend in South Africa.

Since the table does not directly provide the specific monetary value of CSI/SED expenditures for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '33097440.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:04:16.060 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies is indeed 33097440. 

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no specific value provided for investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies, so we cannot determine the value for this year from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies is not explicitly stated for this year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '33097440.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Rand value of investments in projects to improve environmental efficiencies in the year 2021?".

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

The table includes two relevant indicators: "Direct energy consumption i.e. from non-renewable fuels burned" and "Total direct energy consumption - all sources."

The "Direct energy consumption i.e. from non-renewable fuels burned" specifically mentions energy consumption from non-renewable fuels, which is a form of direct energy consumption. However, this indicator does not cover all sources of energy consumption, including indirect sources.

On the other hand, the "Total direct energy consumption - all sources" indicator provides a broader view of direct energy consumption from all sources, which would include both direct and indirect energy consumption.

Given that the "Total direct energy consumption - all sources" indicator encompasses all sources of direct energy consumption, including indirect sources, we can directly retrieve the answer to the question "What was the Total direct and indirect energy consumption in the year 2021?" from the provided table.

In the "EMPLOYEES" section, there is a row for "TRAINING HOURS" with the value of 66986.

Based on the information provided in the table, it is not explicitly stated that the value of 66986 represents the total number of training hours in the year 2021. The table does not specify the time period or year to which the value of 66986 corresponds.

Therefore, based solely on the information presented in the table, I cannot definitively confirm that 66986 is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total number of training hours in the year 2021?"

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:06:17.981 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the volume of electricity consumed – purchased and self-generated in the year 2021, we need to look at the specific values provided in the markdown table. The table includes the following relevant information:

- Net electricity purchased in 2021: 155,685 MWh
- Volume of electricity self-generated in 2021: 450,722 MWh

To determine the total volume of electricity consumed (purchased and self-generated) in 2021, we would need to sum the net electricity purchased and the volume of electricity self-generated. By adding these two values together (155,685 MWh + 450,722 MWh), we can find the total volume of electricity consumed in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Volume of electricity consumed – purchased and self-generated in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

|--------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Net electricity purchased            | MWh               | 155685 | 384855 | 446190 | 406617 |
| Volume of electricity self-generated | MWh               | 450722 | 468565 | 465786 | 425136 |

The Volume of electricity consumed - purchased and self-generated in 2021 would be the sum of Net electricity purchased and Volume of electricity self-generated for that year:

606407 = 155685 + 450722

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Volume of electricity consumed – purchased and self-generated in the year 2021?" is 606407.

Now, looking at the second table for the year 2021:

The table includes indicators such as "Total number of employees and contractors (full-time equivalent)" and "Percentage of employees who are permanent as at 31 March."

The indicator "Total number of employees and contractors (full-time equivalent)" provides the total number of employees and contractors in full-time equivalent units. This indicator directly gives us the information we need to determine the number of employees in the year 2021, as it specifies the total count of employees and contractors.

The table includes indicators such as "Number of person hours worked - employees and contractors" and "Number of employees trained, including internal and external."

The indicator "Number of employees trained, including internal and external" provides the number of employees who received training, but it does not specify whether this includes all employees or only a subset of them. This indicator does not directly give us the total number of employees (full-time equivalent) in the year 2021.

Since there is no specific indicator in the table that directly provides the total number of employees (full-time equivalent) in 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Number of employees (full-time equivalent) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes information on the number of employees currently receiving company-provided ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) and the cost of ART in millions of Rands.

While the table provides information on the cost of ART, it does not explicitly mention the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS. The cost of ART is a specific component of spending related to HIV/AIDS, but it does not encompass all health-related spending or broader CSI/SED initiatives.

Without additional information or specific indicators related to the overall CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS, we cannot determine the total spending in this area for the year 2021 from the provided table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 19:07:29.062 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programs in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific breakdown of expenditures related to these categories in the provided markdown table. 

The table only provides a total figure for Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development expenditures for each year, without a detailed breakdown of how this total amount was allocated across different programs or categories such as basic needs, social development, nutrition, or feeding programs.

Since the table does not provide a specific breakdown of expenditures related to basic needs, social development, nutrition, or feeding programs, we cannot directly retrieve the information on the CSI/SED spend on these specific categories in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programs in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The "Board members" indicator provides the total number of board members, which may include both Executive and Non-executive Board members. However, it does not explicitly state the breakdown between Executive and Non-executive members.

2024-03-10 19:10:30.288 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table only includes information about Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures in South African Rands for the years 2018 to 2021.

The table does not provide explicit information about the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues. It specifically mentions expenditures related to CSI/SED, which is different from assets under management by asset class. Without a direct indicator or data point related to the assets under management by asset class that employ social issues, we cannot determine this information from the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "Land abandoned (no longer under cane)" and "Total - company managed/farmed land (owned and leased)."

The indicator "Total - company managed/farmed land (owned and leased)" provides information on the total area of land managed or farmed by the company, including both owned and leased land. However, this indicator does not specifically break down the total area into owned and leased portions. Without a separate value for the area of leased land within the total, we cannot determine the specific area of forestland leased in the year 2021.

The table includes information under the category "LAND: COMPANY MANAGED LAND (OWNED AND LEASED)" specifically mentioning "ElA approved land - Developments Land" in hectares for the years 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The indicator "ElA approved land - Developments Land" likely refers to a specific type of land managed by the entity, which may not necessarily represent forestland.

However, the table only includes information about land abandoned (no longer under cane) and total company-managed/farmed land (owned and leased).

The indicators in the table do not directly provide information on the area of forestland specifically restored or rehabilitated in 2021. The table focuses on different types of land use such as abandoned land and company-managed/farmed land, but it does not specify the area dedicated to forestland restoration or rehabilitation.

Without a specific indicator related to forestland restoration or rehabilitation, we cannot determine the exact area of forestland restored and/or rehabilitated in 2021 from the information provided in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland restored and/or rehabilitated in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:12:53.611 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this type of spend in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators such as "(SED) expenditures" and "CSI/SED spend as a percentage of total revenue generated."

The indicators in the table do not directly provide information on BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend. The indicators mentioned in the table are related to SED expenditures and CSI/SED spend as a percentage of total revenue generated, which are different from the specific question asked.

Without a specific indicator related to BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact percentage from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 19:13:18.550 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the number of Board members over 50 in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to the age of directors in the provided markdown table. The table includes the "Average age of directors" indicator, which gives us the average age of directors in each year.

However, the average age of directors does not directly provide the exact number of Board members over 50 in 2021. It only gives us the average age of all directors. Without additional information on the total number of directors or a breakdown of the age distribution of directors, we cannot determine the specific number of Board members over 50 in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes information about the number of employees based on gender, type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contractors, seasonal and casual workers), and total employee counts.

There is no direct mention of costs associated with contractors or a breakdown of financial information related to contractors in the table. The table primarily focuses on the number of employees based on different categories and locations.

Without any explicit data on costs or financial figures related to contractors, we cannot determine the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 from the provided table.

The table includes principles related to environmental management, such as supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.

While the table provides responses related to these principles, the responses are general statements about environmental practices and approaches. They do not specifically detail the environmental management policies and practices implemented at active sites in the year 2021. The responses mention goals, targets, and initiatives related to environmental responsibility but do not provide a specific description of the environmental management policies and practices for active sites in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '2021.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:14:51.664 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided rows. The response in the first table focuses on efficiency targets, water, energy, and carbon efficiencies, water neutrality, and carbon emissions targets, but there is no specific mention of the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the additional comments on Environment mention that policies and procedures to manage environmental legal and regulatory compliance have been significantly improved in FY2021. This indicates that there were improvements in environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021?" based on the provided tables is 'Yes'.

The table includes safety measures such as Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and Total Recordable Cases Frequency Rate (TRCFR) for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, along with comments explaining the trends.

While the comments provide some insight into the performance and trends of the safety measures, they do not explicitly discuss the management of accident and safety risks or long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021. The comments mainly focus on explaining the changes in LTIFR and TRCFR without delving into the detailed discussion of risk management strategies or long-term health and safety risks.

2024-03-10 19:15:45.925 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: The provided markdown table does not contain specific information about the discussion of the process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021. The table outlines general principles related to environmental responsibility and a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.

While the principles mentioned in the table touch on environmental responsibility and a precautionary approach, they do not directly address the specific question about the discussion of the process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in 2021. The table focuses on broader environmental goals and initiatives rather than specific discussions or processes related to materials and chemicals of concern on product safety.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.
