Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:13:48.419 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The cell corresponding to the year 2021 is empty, so we cannot determine the B-BBEE Level for that year from this table.

In the second table, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 4. Therefore, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is indeed 4.

In the third table, there is no information provided about the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the B-BBEE Level for the year 2021 is 4 in the second table, and it is not explicitly stated in the first and third tables.

Are you sure that '505575.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Carbon emissions – Scope 1 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:13:59.265 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Carbon emissions - Scope 1 for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine the exact value for that year from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Total scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year 2021 is given as 557114. This value includes both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, so we cannot isolate the specific value for scope 1 emissions in 2021 from this table.

Considering the information provided in the tables, we do not have a direct value for the Carbon emissions - Scope 1 in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Carbon emissions – Scope 1 in the year 2021?" is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:14:36.229 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 20%. Therefore, '20.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question for this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 20%. So, '20.0' is again the correct answer for this table.

Lastly, in the third table, the Percentage of female Board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for other years are given, but the specific value for 2021 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact Percentage of female Board members for 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Value of employee training spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:14:54.915 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in the row related to employee training spend. The value '66986' is mentioned under the "TRAINING HOURS" category, which does not directly correspond to the employee training spend for the year 2021.

In the second table, the value '8760' is mentioned under the "EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING" category, which also does not directly represent the employee training spend for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be conclusively determined that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the employee training spend in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:15:09.456 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no explicit mention of the total number of training hours for the year 2021. The only information provided is 66986 training hours for employees, but it is not specified for which year this data corresponds to.

In the second table, the information provided is "(2020: 9 331)" under the EMPLOYEES column, which seems to indicate the number of employees for the year 2020, not the total number of training hours for 2020. Therefore, there is no direct mention of the total number of training hours for the year 2021 in this table either.

Moving on to the third table, the row "Number of employees trained, including internal and external" provides the total number of employees trained for each year, but it does not directly mention the total number of training hours for the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to determine the total number of training hours specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

| Volume of electricity self-generated | MWh               | 450722 | 468565 | 465786 | 425136 |

The Volume of electricity consumed - purchased and self-generated in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table. The total volume of electricity consumed in 2021 is not directly given here.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021:

|                                                               | Unit of measure   |     2021 |     2020 |     2019 |     2018 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Volume of electricity consumed - purchased and self-generated | MWh               | 606407   | 853420   | 911976   | 831753   |
| Percentage of electricity consumed that was self-generated    | %                 |     74.3 |     54.9 |     51.1 |     51.1 |

The Volume of electricity consumed - purchased and self-generated in 2021 is explicitly provided as 606407 MWh in this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Volume of electricity consumed – purchased and self-generated in the year 2021?" is 606407.0.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:15:32.297 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the cost of ART is given as 1.2 (R million). This value represents the cost of antiretroviral therapy and not the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, the correct answer to the question "What was the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS in the year 2021?" is not explicitly stated as 1.2.

Moving on to the other tables, there is no direct mention of the CSI/SED spend on health, including HIV/AIDS for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in all the tables, the answer to the question cannot be conclusively determined.

Are you sure that '5258537.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:15:35.695 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is '5258537.0' for 2021 based on this table.

Looking at the third table, the CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 5258537. Therefore, we can confirm that the value is '5258537.0' for 2021 based on this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:15:54.615 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is only given for Total scope 2 emissions.

In the second table, the Total scope 1 emissions for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 505575. However, this table does not provide the Total scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2021.

In the third table, the Carbon emissions - Scope 1 for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 505575. This table does not provide the Total scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Total carbon emissions – Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 557114.0.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:00.929 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the value of Executive Board members in the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - The row for Executive Board members is present, but the value for 2021 is not provided. The last known value is for the year 2018, which is 2.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the value of Executive Board members for 2021 in this table.

2. In the second table:
   - The row for Executive Board members is present, and the value for 2021 is provided as 3.
   - The value for 2021 Executive Board members in this table is 3.

3. In the third table:
   - The row for Executive Board members is present, and the value for 2021 is provided as 3.
   - The value for 2021 Executive Board members in this table is also 3.

Conclusion: The correct answer to the question "What was the Executive Board members in the year 2021?" is '3.0' based on the information provided in the second and third tables.

Are you sure that '505575.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:12.975 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the carbon emissions for CO in the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The value '505575' corresponds to carbon emissions - Scope 1 in tCO2e for the year 2021, not specifically for CO.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:17.982 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row for "Petrol used by contractor equipment" shows a value of 2 for carbon emissions. This does not directly provide information about volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the specific emissions of VOCs for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '122433239.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:27.289 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The amount of Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in 2021 is 122,433,239 Rands.
- The question is asking for the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021.
- The table does not provide information on assets under management by asset class, so we cannot determine if 122,433,239.0 is the correct answer.

For the second table:
- The amount of Corporate social investment (CSI)/Socio-economic development (SED) expenditures in 2021 is 122,433,239.
- The question is asking for the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021.
- The table does not provide information on assets under management by asset class, so we cannot determine if 122,433,239.0 is the correct answer.

For the third table:
- The percentage of management (top and senior) who are women in 2021 is 28.2%.
- The question is asking for the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021.
- The table does not provide information on assets under management by asset class, so we cannot determine if 122,433,239.0 is the correct answer.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '122433239.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:32.917 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 states that there were 3 environmental fines and/or non-compliances.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that the amount of fines paid or payable in 2021 was 3.0.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 states that there were 3 environmental fines and/or non-compliances.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that the amount of fines paid or payable in 2021 was 3.0.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 is not provided in the table.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, there is no specific mention of food waste recovered, so we cannot determine the volume of food waste sent for recycling in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, there is no mention of food waste or food waste recovery, so we cannot determine the volume of food waste sent for recycling in 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '99.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:42.559 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is 99%.
- The value for 2021 is explicitly provided in the table.
- Therefore, '99.0' is the correct answer to the question.

For the second table:
- The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 is not provided in this table.
- The values provided are for Auditor Remuneration and Length of current auditor's service.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table.

For the third table:
- The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 is not provided in this table.
- The values provided are for Length of current auditor's service and Independence of Board Chairman.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: 
- '99.0' is the correct answer based on the first table.
- No, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from the second and third tables.

The value '66986' is listed under the column 'TRAINING HOURS' without specifying the year. Therefore, we cannot determine the average hours of training for the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value '(2020: 9 331)' is listed under the column 'EMPLOYEES' without specifying the year for the training hours. Similarly, we cannot determine the average hours of training for the year 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the value '(2020: 656)' is listed under the column 'EMPLOYEES' without specifying the year for the training hours. Additionally, the row 'EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING' does not provide a specific value for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:50.913 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. Table 1:
   - The table does not provide any specific value for the year 2021.
   - It only mentions "TRAINING HOURS" without a specific number.

2. Table 2:
   - The table provides a value of 66986 for "TRAINING HOURS."
   - This value is not explicitly linked to the year 2021.

3. Table 3:
   - The table mentions "(2020: 656)" for "EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING."
   - This value is specifically for the year 2020 and not for 2021.

Based on the analysis of the tables, none of the tables provide a direct answer to the question about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021. Therefore, the correct answer is **no**.

Are you sure that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:54.735 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021. The value '66986' is provided under the column 'TRAINING HOURS', but it is not explicitly stated that this value corresponds to the year 2021.

In the second table, the value '(2020: 9 331)' is provided under the column 'EMPLOYEES', and 'TRAINING HOURS' is mentioned. There is no direct mention of the year 2021 in this table.

In the third table, the value '(2020: 656)' is provided under the column 'EMPLOYEES', and 'EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING' is mentioned. Again, there is no direct mention of the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be conclusively determined that '66986.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:16:58.649 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the number of training hours in the year 2021. The value "(2020: 9 331)" is mentioned for employees in 2020, but no corresponding value is given for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the value "66986" is mentioned for training hours, but there is no indication of which year this corresponds to. Without a clear reference to the year 2021, we cannot conclude that this is the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the value "(2020: 656)" is provided for employees in 2020, but again, there is no specific value mentioned for the year 2021. The phrase "EMPLOYEES ATTENDING TRAINING" does not provide a numerical value for the number of training hours in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:17:03.455 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. In the first table, the value for training hours is not provided for the year 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

2. In the second table, the value for training hours is explicitly stated as 66986, but there is no indication that this value specifically relates to anti-corruption training. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

3. In the third table, the value for employees attending training is provided for the year 2020, but there is no mention of the number of training hours. Therefore, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, we do not have sufficient information to determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021. 

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:17:12.084 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the total number of Board members is 10. There is no specific breakdown provided for Board members between the ages of 30-50 for the year 2021 in this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we see that there are 7 Independent Board members. Again, there is no specific information provided about the age range of these Independent Board members.

In the third table for the year 2021, the average age of directors is given as 54. This average age does not provide a direct answer to the question of how many Board members are between the ages of 30-50 in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact number of Board members between the ages of 30-50 in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '5.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:17:20.303 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table:

|                                      | Unit of measure   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Average length of full Board service | years             |    1.5 |    0.6 |   3.17 |   9.85 |
| Average age of directors             | number            |   54   |   51.3 |  52.5  |  58.1  |

In the table, we can see that the average age of directors in 2021 was 54. There is no specific information provided about the number of Board members over 50 in 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of Board members over 50 in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table:

|                             | Unit of measure   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Board members               | number            |     10 |     10 |     10 |     11 |
| Non-executive Board members | number            |      7 |      7 |      7 |      9 |

In this table, we can see that there were 10 Board members in 2021. However, there is no specific information provided about the age distribution of Board members in this table.

Lastly, let's look at the third table:

|                                              | Unit of measure   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Percentage of female Board members           | %                 |     20 |   10   |  20    |  45.5  |
| Average length of executive director service | years             |      2 |    0.9 |   0.12 |  17.76 |

In this table, there is no information provided about the age or gender distribution of Board members in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact number of Board members over 50 in the year 2021. The answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:17:27.534 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for South Africa, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are not explicitly provided in the table. The values for Contractor costs are given separately for Fixed Term Contractors and Seasonal and Casual Workers, but the total Contractor costs for the year 2021 are not directly stated.

In the second table for Mozambique, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are also not explicitly provided. Similar to the first table, the values for Fixed Term Contractors and Seasonal and Casual Workers are given separately, but the total Contractor costs for the year 2021 are not explicitly mentioned.

In the third table for Zimbabwe, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 are not explicitly stated. The values for Fixed Term Contractors and Seasonal and Casual Workers are provided separately, but the total Contractor costs for the year 2021 are not directly given.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the answer to the question "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '2021.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:17:37.935 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no mention of the year 2021 or any specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in that year. The focus is on setting efficiency targets, improving environmental performance, and encouraging responsible operations.

2. In the second table, there is a mention of policies and procedures being significantly improved in FY2021, including the appointment of a group Environmental Compliance Officer. However, this does not provide a specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in 2021.

3. In the third table, there is a general statement about supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and setting efficiency targets for environmental performance. There is no specific description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '2021.0' in any of the tables.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.
