Answer:

2024-03-09 16:10:20.036 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021, we need to calculate the change in Accumulated Depreciation for each asset category from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. This change represents the Depreciation expense for the year.

Let's calculate the Depreciation for each asset category:

1. Land, Buildings and Land Improvements: 427,823 (Accumulated Depreciation at the end of the year) - 0 (Assuming no Accumulated Depreciation at the beginning of the year) = 427,823

2. Furniture and Equipment: 562,604 - 0 = 562,604

3. Computers and Hardware: 299,038 - 0 = 299,038

4. Motor Vehicles: 25,195 - 0 = 25,195

5. Assets Under Construction: Since there is no Accumulated Depreciation at the end of the year, we cannot calculate the Depreciation for this category.

Now, let's sum up the Depreciation for all asset categories:
Depreciation = 427,823 + 562,604 + 299,038 + 25,195 = 1,314,660

Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is R1,314,660.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:10:26.398 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021, we need to calculate the change in the Accumulated Depreciation for the year. The formula to calculate this change is:

Change in Accumulated Depreciation = Accumulated Depreciation at the end of the year - Accumulated Depreciation at the beginning of the year

From the table provided, we have the Accumulated Depreciation at the beginning of the year (Balance 1 January 2021) for Land, Buildings and Land Improvements as 147,559 R'000 and for Motor Vehicles as 22,470 R'000.

However, the table does not provide the Accumulated Depreciation at the end of the year for Land, Buildings and Land Improvements and Motor Vehicles.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:10:30.693 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: First, let's focus on the first table for Land, Buildings and Land Improvements. The row for Accumulated depreciation 31 December 2021 shows a value of 427,823. This represents the accumulated depreciation up to the end of 2021 for Land, Buildings and Land Improvements.

Next, let's move on to the second table for Furniture and Equipment. The row for Accumulated depreciation 31 December 2021 shows a value of 562,604. This represents the accumulated depreciation up to the end of 2021 for Furniture and Equipment.

Then, looking at the row for Computers and Hardware in the second table, the accumulated depreciation as of 31 December 2021 is 299,038.

For Motor Vehicles in the second table, the accumulated depreciation as of 31 December 2021 is 25,195.

Lastly, for Assets Under Construction in the first table, there is no value provided for Accumulated depreciation as of 31 December 2021.

Adding up all these accumulated depreciation values for the different categories gives us a total of 1,314,660.0. Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is indeed 1,314,660.0.

For wages and salaries:
- Academic Professionals: 1476469
- Other: 1952948

To find the total wages and salaries for all employees, we sum these two values:
1476469 + 1952948 = 3429417

For termination benefits:
- Academic Professionals: 13583
- Other: 19769

To find the total termination benefits for all employees, we sum these two values:
13583 + 19769 = 33352

Therefore, the total Employee wages and benefits in the year 2021 is the sum of total wages and salaries and total termination benefits:
3429417 (Wages and salaries) + 33352 (Termination benefits) = 3462769

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:10:50.120 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: First, let's look at the first table for the year 2021. The total expenses in the income statement for 2021 are R'81,900, and the interest on obligation is R'64,600. However, the table does not provide the specific finance cost for 2021.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we see that the interest is R'172 and the net finance costs are (18). The net finance costs include interest expenses and interest income. Since we are interested in the finance cost, we should consider the interest expense, which is R'172.

Therefore, the finance cost per income statement in the year 2021 is R'172, not -18.0.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:10:56.131 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the GHG Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to understand what Scope 1 emissions are. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions that come from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. In the table, the "Direct / on-site" location refers to emissions that are directly produced by the organization.

Looking at the table, the "Fugitive emissions" source category under the "Direct / on-site" location includes intentional or unintentional release of GHGs. This could potentially cover Scope 1 emissions if the organization's activities result in direct emissions on-site. However, the table does not provide specific data or values for GHG emissions in the year 2021. It only indicates the presence of emissions in general.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the GHG Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021. The table does not contain the necessary data or details to pinpoint the specific emissions for that year.

1. The table includes columns for "Location", "Source Category", "Explanation", and "2020 & 2021 Boundary".
2. The row that seems to be related to emissions is the one with "On-site" under "Location" and "Fugitive emissions" under "Source Category".
3. The "Explanation" column states that these are intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs not included under the Kyoto Protocol.
4. The "2020 & 2021 Boundary" column has a checkmark (✓) which might indicate that this category is relevant for both 2020 and 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:13.487 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to understand what Scope 3 emissions are. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.

Looking at the table, the categories mentioned are related to direct emissions (Scope 1) and possibly some indirect emissions (Scope 2), but there is no specific mention of Scope 3 emissions. The table only includes information about fugitive emissions and process emissions, which are typically considered Scope 1 emissions.

Since Scope 3 emissions are not explicitly mentioned in the table, we cannot find the answer to the question about GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 in this table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:16.559 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to understand the different scopes of greenhouse gas emissions. 

- Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization.
- Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.
- Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.

The table provided only mentions on-site fugitive emissions and biofuels, which are typically categorized under Scope 1 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are usually related to activities outside the direct control of the organization, such as purchased goods and services, transportation, and waste disposal.

Since the table does not mention any specific data related to Scope 3 emissions or activities that fall under Scope 3, it is unlikely that the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 can be found in this table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:19.304 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to look for any information related to Scope 3 emissions specifically for the year 2021.

1. The table includes columns for "Location," "Source Category," "Explanation," and "2020 & 2021 Boundary."
2. The row that mentions "On-site" and "Fugitive emissions" states that it involves the intentional or unintentional release of GHGs not included under the Kyoto Protocol.
3. However, there is no explicit mention of GHG Scope 3 emissions or emissions specifically for the year 2021 in the table.

Based on the information provided in the table, the answer is **no**.

The table includes entries for "Income from associate" and "Changes in working capital," but neither of these entries represent Other Income. The "Income from associate" is a separate category, and "Changes in working capital" typically refers to adjustments related to current assets and liabilities, not Other Income.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Other Income as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:23.875 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Other Income as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to calculate the net effect of the amounts received during the year and the amounts released to the income statement. 

In this case, we would subtract the amount released to the income statement from the amount received during the year for the year 2021. 

So, the calculation would be:
Other Income 2021 = Received during the year 2021 - Released to the income statement 2021
Other Income 2021 = 23,309 - (-40,267)
Other Income 2021 = 23,309 + 40,267
Other Income 2021 = 63,576

Therefore, the Other Income as per the income statement in the year 2021 is R'000 63,576.

Are you sure that '183547.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Revenue in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:40.510 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Let's analyze the second table first:

| Associates' revenue and losses: -    | 2021 R'000 - UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd   | 2021 R'000 - Hyplat (Pty) Ltd   | 2020 R'000 - UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd   | 2020 R'000 - Hyplat (Pty) Ltd   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Revenue                              | 183547                                      | 1733                            | 160131                                      | 5239                            |
| Cost of sales                        | (100 689)                                   | (102)                           | (94 452)                                    | (59)                            |

In this table, the revenue for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 183547.0 for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd. Therefore, the Revenue for the year 2021 is indeed 183547.0 according to this table.

Now, let's move on to the first table:

|                                             |   2021 R'000 |   2020 R'000 |

| Rendering of services                       |       696769 |       528174 |
| Total revenue from contracts with customers |      2775542 |      2024664 |

In this table, the Revenue for the year 2021 is not explicitly given. However, the total revenue from contracts with customers is provided as 2775542 for the year 2021. This total includes the revenue from rendering of services. Therefore, the Revenue for the year 2021 can be considered as 2775542, which includes the revenue from rendering of services.

Conclusion: Yes, 183547.0 is the correct answer to the question "What was the Revenue in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:45.098 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021, we need to sum up the values of Land, Buildings and Land Improvements, Furniture and Equipment, Computers and Hardware, Motor Vehicles, Assets Under Construction, and Accumulated depreciation and impairment as of 1 January 2021.

Given the table, we have the following values:
- Land, Buildings and Land Improvements: 378239
- Furniture and Equipment: 501040
- Computers and Hardware: 247823
- Motor Vehicles: 22202
- Assets Under Construction: -
- Accumulated depreciation and impairment: -

To calculate the Total assets, we sum up the values:
Total assets = Land, Buildings and Land Improvements + Furniture and Equipment + Computers and Hardware + Motor Vehicles + Assets Under Construction + Accumulated depreciation and impairment
Total assets = 378239 + 501040 + 247823 + 22202 + 0 + 0
Total assets = 1153304

Therefore, the Total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021 is 1153304.

Looking at the provided markdown table, we can see that the table includes information on various asset categories such as Land, Buildings and Land Improvements, Furniture and Equipment, Computers and Hardware, Motor Vehicles, Assets Under Construction, and a Total column.

The information provided in the table seems to be related to disposals and zero book value adjustments for the assets. However, to determine the Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021, we would need the initial values of these assets before any disposals or adjustments were made during the year.

Since the table only provides information on disposals and adjustments without the initial values of the assets, we cannot directly determine the Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:50.550 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021, we need to consider the changes in the assets from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 

Given the markdown table, we have information for the assets as of 1 January 2020 and the disposals during the year. However, we do not have the ending balances for the year 2021 directly provided in the table.

To calculate the Total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021, we would need additional information such as the additions to the assets during the year, any revaluations, impairments, or other changes that occurred during the year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table alone, we cannot determine the Total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:11:57.330 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of employees in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Wages and salaries" row in the table. The total number of employees can be estimated by dividing the total wages and salaries by the average salary per employee.

Given that the total wages and salaries for 2021 is 3,429,417 (in R'000), we need to know the average salary per employee to calculate the total number of employees. However, the table does not provide the average salary per employee or any direct information about the total number of employees.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the total number of employees in the year 2021.

The total number of employees can be estimated by adding the number of Academic Professionals and Other employees in 2020.

From the table provided:
- Academic Professionals in 2020: 1373169 (R'000)
- Other employees in 2020: 1822912 (R'000)

To find the total number of employees in 2020, we add these two values:
Total employees in 2020 = 1373169 + 1822912 = 3196081

Therefore, the total number of employees in the year 2020 was 3,196,081. However, this table does not provide any direct information about the total number of employees in the year 2021. So, the answer to the question "What was the Total number of employees in the year 2021?" cannot be found in this table.

The metric we are interested in is "tCO2e / m2 / annum" as it represents the GHG emissions per square meter per year.

Looking at the table, we can see that the value for "tCO2e / m2 / annum" for the Financial Year 2021 is 0.092. This value represents the GHG emissions per square meter per year for the year 2021.

To calculate the GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) in the year 2021, we would need additional information such as the revenue generated in the year 2021 and the breakdown of GHG emissions into Scope 1 and Scope 2 categories. Since this information is not provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 based on the data given.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

2024-03-09 16:12:22.438 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021, we need to look at the sum of the Tonnes of CO2e for all the scopes in the year 2021. In the provided table, we only have data for Scope 1 emissions for two specific sources in the years 2020 and 2021. Since we don't have information on Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, we cannot directly calculate the Total Absolute GHG emissions for all scopes in 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:12:27.174 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021, we need to look for rows in the table that correspond to scope 1 emissions and sum up the values for the year 2021.

Looking at the table, the rows that seem to represent scope 1 emissions are "Fugitive Emissions (Kyoto & non-Kyoto Gases)" and "Stationary Combustion: LPG". The values in these rows represent the emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent for each year.

For the year 2021, the values are 1342 tonnes for "Fugitive Emissions (Kyoto & non-Kyoto Gases)" and 40 tonnes for "Stationary Combustion: LPG". To calculate the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in 2021, we need to sum these two values.

1342 (Fugitive Emissions) + 40 (Stationary Combustion: LPG) = 1382 tonnes of CO2 equivalent

Therefore, the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021 is 1382 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:12:30.547 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021, we need to look for data related to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization (scope 1), indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (scope 2), and other indirect emissions such as those from the supply chain (scope 3).

In the provided markdown table, the Source Category "Fugitive emissions" could potentially include direct emissions (scope 1) if it refers to unintentional releases of GHGs from sources owned or controlled by the organization. However, without specific data on the actual GHG emissions values associated with this category, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions for scope 1.

The Source Category "Process Emissions" typically falls under scope 1 emissions if it refers to GHG emissions from physical or chemical processing activities within the organization's control. Again, without specific GHG emissions values provided in the table, we cannot calculate the Total Absolute GHG emissions for scope 1.

Since the table does not contain the actual GHG emissions values for scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 for the year 2021, we cannot find the answer to the question based on the information provided in the table.

From the table provided:
- The first column seems to represent section numbers or headings.
- The second column seems to provide a brief description of the content in that section.
- The third column seems to contain numerical values related to the corresponding sections.

Since we are looking for information related to Air emissions of VOCs in the year 2021, we should focus on the content in the table that specifically mentions emissions of VOCs or air pollutants for the year 2021. However, based on the information provided in the table, there is no direct mention of VOCs or air emissions for the year 2021.

In this case, the values provided are for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd and Hyplat (Pty) Ltd separately.

For UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd in 2021, the Administrative expenses are (73 908) R'000.

For Hyplat (Pty) Ltd in 2021, the Administrative expenses are (4 768) R'000.

To calculate the total Administrative expenses for the year 2021, we need to sum these two values:

Total Administrative expenses in 2021 = (73 908) + (4 768) = (78 676) R'000

Therefore, the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021 is (78 676) R'000.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:15:21.962 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021, we need to look at the attendance of the members in the meetings held in 2021. The table provides information on the attendance of two members, Ms D Yach and Mr V Motholo, in the meetings held on 26 Feb 2021, 12 Mar 2021, 4 Jun 2021, and 19 Nov 2021.

For Ms D Yach:
- Attended on 26 Feb 2021 (Ap)
- Attended on 12 Mar 2021 (P)
- Attended on 4 Jun 2021 (P)
- Absent on 19 Nov 2021 (Ap)

For Mr V Motholo:
- Not applicable (N/A) for all meetings except 19 Nov 2021 where he attended (P)

To calculate the attendance rate for each member:
- Ms D Yach attended 3 out of 4 meetings, so her attendance rate is 75%.
- Mr V Motholo attended 1 out of 1 meeting, so his attendance rate is 100%.

Therefore, the overall Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 cannot be directly determined from the provided table as it only shows the attendance of individual members in specific meetings.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:15:24.842 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:

- Mr H Maritz attended all meetings in the year 2021, so his attendance rate is 100%.
- Dr R Morar also attended all meetings in the year 2021, so his attendance rate is 100%.

Therefore, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 for the first table is indeed 100%.

For the second table:

- Prof J Raju attended all meetings in the year 2021, so his attendance rate is 100%.
- Mr A Goso missed one meeting in the year 2021, so his attendance rate is 75%.

Therefore, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 for the second table is not explicitly stated as 100%.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:15:27.573 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average hours of training in the year 2021, we need to sum up the training hours for both part-time and students in 2021 and then divide by the total number of categories (which is 2 in this case).

Sum of training hours in 2021:
Part-time: 1870 hours
Students: 1711 hours

Total training hours in 2021 = 1870 + 1711 = 3581 hours

Now, to find the average hours of training in 2021, we divide the total training hours by the number of categories (2):
Average hours of training in 2021 = 3581 / 2 = 1790.5 hours

Therefore, the average hours of training in the year 2021 is 1790.5 hours.

1. Total hours of training for full-time employees in 2021 = 5663 R'000
2. Total hours of training for part-time employees in 2021 = 1870 R'000
3. Total hours of training in 2021 = 5663 + 1870 = 7533 R'000

Since the table does not provide the total number of full-time and part-time employees in 2021, we cannot calculate the average hours of training for the year 2021 using the information given in the table.

2024-03-09 16:16:12.777 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total spend from QSEs and then divide it by the total spend for all procurement.

Looking at the table provided, we can see that the total spend for the "ICT Upper Campus datacentre refurbishment" project is 9259 R'000, and the total spend for the "ICT storage architecture renewal" project is 21381 R'000. However, we do not have information on the breakdown of these amounts in terms of QSEs and non-QSEs.

Since the table does not provide specific information on the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs, we cannot directly calculate the percentage of total spend from QSEs. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the given markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:16:15.636 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total spend from QSEs and then divide it by the total spend for all procurement.

Looking at the table provided, we can see the total spend for each project:

- For ICT network renewal: Total spend = 12899
- For ICT Upper Campus datacentre refurbishment: Total spend = 9259

To calculate the total spend for all procurement, we need to sum up the total spend for both projects:

Total spend for all procurement = 12899 + 9259 = 22158

Since the table does not provide information specifically about the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), we cannot directly calculate the percentage without additional data. We would need to know the breakdown of the spend from QSEs for each project to calculate the percentage.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:16:27.925 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the answer to the question, we need to calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a percentage of the total spend in the year 2021. 

1. First, we need to identify the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's. This information is not directly provided in the table. We can assume that the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's is the sum of the "Contracted (purchase order raised)" amounts for both buildings.

2. For the Avenue Road building, the BBBEE procurement spend would be 33.

3. For the Teacher Education building, the BBBEE procurement spend would be 971.

4. The total BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's would be 33 + 971 = 1004.

5. Next, we need to calculate the total spend for the year 2021. This is given by the "Total" column in the table, which is 1600 for the Avenue Road building and 10499 for the Teacher Education building. The total spend for the year 2021 would be 1600 + 10499 = 12099.

6. Finally, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's by the total spend and multiplying by 100: (1004 / 12099) * 100 ≈ 8.31%.

Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 8.31%.

In this table, the race categories are "Race - SA African," "Race - SA Coloured," "Race - SA Indian," "Race - SA White," "Race - Other/Unknown," and "Race - International."

Since we are interested in Black female executive directors, we should focus on the "Race - SA African" category, as this is likely where Black individuals are represented. Then, we need to look at the "Sex - Female" column to find the percentage of females within this race category.

However, the table provided does not have a row specifically for the year 2021. The only year mentioned in the table is 2017. Therefore, we cannot find the answer to the question regarding the percentage of Black female executive directors in the year 2021 from this table.

For Mr H Maritz:

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:16:59.007 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for Mr H Maritz, the attendance for the Board meeting on 19 Nov 2021 is marked as N/A, which means it is not applicable or not available. Therefore, we cannot determine the attendance rate for the year 2021 for Mr H Maritz based on the information provided in the table.

Looking at the second table for Dr R Morar, the attendance for all Board meetings in the year 2021 is marked as 'P', indicating present. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the attendance rate for Dr R Morar in the year 2021 is 100%.

Conclusion: No, we cannot determine the overall Board meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 based on the information provided in the tables.

In the provided table, there is no direct mention of "Contractor costs." However, we can make an assumption that the "Rendering of services" category might include costs related to contractors.

Therefore, to calculate the Contractor costs per income statement in 2021, we would need to subtract the income generated from the Rendering of services from the total amount in the Rendering of services category. This would give us an estimate of the costs associated with rendering services, which may include contractor costs.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:17:51.758 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total cost of acquisition for the assets listed in the table. The cost of acquisition is typically the initial cost incurred to acquire an asset before any depreciation or adjustments.

Looking at the table, we can see that the initial cost of acquiring assets such as Land, Buildings and Land Improvements, Furniture and Equipment, Computers and Hardware, and Motor Vehicles is not directly provided. Instead, the table shows the Depreciation and Zero book value adjustment amounts for these assets.

To calculate the total cost of acquisition, we would need to add the Depreciation and Zero book value adjustment amounts back to the current book value of the assets. Since the initial cost of acquisition is not explicitly provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 from the information given.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

2024-03-09 16:18:05.320 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To answer the question about the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Explanation" column in the markdown table provided.

Looking at the table, we can see that the Explanation column provides details about the operations related to different categories such as franchises and investments. However, the information in the table seems to focus on the operation of franchises and investments in the downstream sector, without specific mention of ESG factors in investment or wealth management processes.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, it does not directly provide the Description of approach to incorporation of ESG factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021.

The table appears to provide details about the Council of the University of Cape Town, including statements on corporate governance and the responsibilities of the Council. 

However, the specific information related to the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in the table. The table mainly focuses on the Council's governance and responsibilities, which may not directly address the specific topic of corruption and bribery prevention in the value chain.

Therefore, based on the content of the table provided, the answer to the question cannot be found in this markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 16:18:37.525 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the description of the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain in the year 2021, we need to look at the content of the markdown table provided. The table consists of three columns: "1", "Executive Summary", and ".5". The first column seems to represent section numbers or identifiers, the second column contains the titles or descriptions of those sections, and the third column may represent some sort of numerical values associated with each section.

Based on the information provided in the table, the description of the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain in the year 2021 is not explicitly present in the table. The table seems to outline different sections or components of a document or report, but it does not directly address the specific question about the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.
