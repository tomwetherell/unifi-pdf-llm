You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '183547.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Revenue in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:18:21.489 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: First, let's look at the first table for the year 2021. The Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021 can be calculated by summing up the amounts under Land, Buildings and Land Improvements, Furniture and Equipment, Computers and Hardware, Motor Vehicles, and Assets Under Construction.

Total assets in 2021 = 1149304 R'000

Next, let's look at the second table for the year 2021. There are disposals and zero book value adjustments mentioned, but these do not affect the Total assets as per balance sheet for the year 2021. Therefore, the Total assets remain the same as calculated from the first table.

Total assets in 2021 = 1149304 R'000

Finally, let's look at the third table for the year 2021. The balance 1 January 2020 values are provided in this table, but we are interested in the year 2021. Therefore, this table does not provide any relevant information for the Total assets in 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021 is 1149304 R'000.

Are you sure that '959.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG Scope 1 emissions + GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:18:32.349 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - There is no information about Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions in this table for the year 2021.
   - The table focuses on Direct / on-site emissions and does not provide data for Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.
   
2. **Table 2**:
   - The table provides information on Sub-Total Scope 3 emissions and Other Direct emissions for the year 2021.
   - There is no specific mention of Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions in this table for the year 2021.

3. **Table 3**:
   - The table provides data for Scope 1 emissions, including Fugitive Emissions (Kyoto Gases) and Stationary Combustion: LPG emissions for the year 2021.
   - However, this table only covers Scope 1 emissions and does not include information on Scope 2 emissions.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, the information required to calculate the GHG Scope 1 emissions + GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 is not explicitly available. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the GHG Scope 1 emissions + GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021?" cannot be determined from the given tables.

**Conclusion: No**

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:18:38.845 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table.
- The table only shows the Tonnes of CO2e for 2020 and 2021, as well as the percentage of total emissions for those years.
- There is no direct information to calculate the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 based on the data provided in this table.

For the second table:
- The GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table.
- Similar to the first table, the table only shows the Tonnes of CO2e for 2020 and 2021, as well as the percentage of total emissions for those years.
- There is no direct information to calculate the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 based on the data provided in this table.

For the third table:
- The GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table.
- The table shows the Gross Area and tCO2e per m2 per annum for the years 2012, 2020, and 2021.
- The value of 0.092 tCO2e/m2/annum is provided for the year 2021, which is the GHG intensity per area for that year.

Conclusion: Yes, the GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) in the year 2021 is 0.092 based on the data provided in the third table.

Are you sure that '999.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:18:43.358 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total Absolute GHG emissions for Scope 1 in the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The table only shows the Tonnes of CO2e for specific sources within Scope 1 for 2021, but not the total for all sources within Scope 1.

Moving on to the second table, the Tonnes of CO2 equivalent for each source within Scope 1 are provided for the years 2020 and 2021, but again, the total for all sources within Scope 1 is not explicitly given for 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, the Total Absolute GHG emissions for Scope 1 - 3 in the year 2021 are not mentioned. The table only provides information on specific source categories and their explanations, but not the total emissions for all scopes in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to determine that '999.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021?"

Conclusion: No

The income from associate in the year 2021 is (513) R'000.

For the second table:
The income from associates in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The value provided is for the year 2020, which is 241 R'000.

For the third table:
The provision for expected losses in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The values provided are for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 513.0 R'000.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:19:09.115 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the Air emissions of SOx in the year 2021 is explicitly stated:

1. **Table 1**:
   - No specific mention of SOx emissions in the year 2021. The closest related information is about Absolute Emissions and Intensity Metrics, but not specifically for SOx.
   - Conclusion: Insufficient information to determine the Air emissions of SOx in the year 2021.

2. **Table 2**:
   - No mention of SOx emissions in the year 2021. The table discusses Stationary Combustion Emissions and Scope 2, but not specifically for SOx.
   - Conclusion: Insufficient information to determine the Air emissions of SOx in the year 2021.

3. **Table 3**:
   - Again, no direct mention of SOx emissions in the year 2021. The table talks about Results Summary and Absolute Emissions, but not specifically for SOx.
   - Conclusion: Insufficient information to determine the Air emissions of SOx in the year 2021.

Overall Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the provided tables, none of them explicitly state the Air emissions of SOx in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (3) SOx in the year 2021?" is **no**.

   - VOCs emissions not explicitly mentioned for 2021
   - No information on VOCs emissions for 2021 in this table

2. **Table 2:**
   - Year in question: 2021
   - Relevant row: Stationary Combustion Emissions
   - VOCs emissions not explicitly mentioned for 2021
   - No information on VOCs emissions for 2021 in this table

Are you sure that '-147182.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:19:22.268 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table for 2021:
   - Administrative expenses: (73 908)
   - Net finance costs: (4 274)
   Therefore, the total administrative expenses for 2021 would be (73 908) R'000.

2. In the second table for 2021:
   - Other income: 451
   - Administrative expenses: (73 908)
   Therefore, the total administrative expenses for 2021 would still be (73 908) R'000.

3. In the third table for 2021:
   - Income tax expense: (1 023)
   - Profit/(loss) for the year: 4104
   There is no explicit mention of administrative expenses in this table for 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the total administrative expenses for the year 2021 are consistently shown as (73 908) R'000. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021?" is (73 908) R'000, not -147182.0.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '927503.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:19:32.212 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the amount of assets under management for Equity collective investment schemes is 927,503 R'000. However, there is no specific value provided for UNLISTED INVESTMENTS for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, for the year 2021, the amount of investments is 8,932,003 R'000. There is no specific value provided for Right-of-use assets for the year 2021.

In the third table, there is no information related to assets under management or investments for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021?" is **No**. The value of 927,503 R'000 corresponds to Equity collective investment schemes, not assets under management that employ social issues.

Are you sure that '112633.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:19:42.251 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The only information given for 2021 is the Payments and Terminations amounts, which do not directly relate to fines paid or payable due to settlements.

Moving on to the second table, there is no mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements for either 2021 or 2020. The table only provides information about retention allowances for Mr RN Pillay and Mr M Parker.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no indication of fines paid or payable due to settlements for 2021. The only relevant information is about leave encashment at resignation for Mr A Francis, but this does not pertain to fines paid or payable due to settlements.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '112633.0'. 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:19:56.192 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- Mr H Maritz attended all meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.
- Dr R Morar also attended all meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.

For the second table:
- Prof J Raju attended all meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.
- Mr A Goso attended three out of four meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 75%.

For the third table:
- Ms D Yach attended two out of four meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 50%.
- Mr V Motholo attended one out of four meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 25%.

Therefore, the overall Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the tables. The attendance rates for individual members are provided, but the overall rate for the committee as a whole is not explicitly stated.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:20:07.026 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- Mr H Maritz attended all the meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.
- Dr R Morar also attended all the meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.

For the second table:
- Ms Z Khanyile attended 3 out of 4 meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 75%.
- Mr B Jakoet attended all the meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.

For the third table:
- Prof M Phakeng attended all the meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.
- A/Prof T Gebbie attended all the meetings in 2021, so the attendance rate is 100%.

Considering each table individually, the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is indeed 100%.

Are you sure that '17300.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:20:12.821 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row "Income from commercial research contracts" shows a value of 98478 R'000. There is no mention of "Contractor costs" in this table.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the row "Expenses in the income statement" shows a value of 81900 R'000, but this does not specifically mention "Contractor costs."

Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, the row "- Current service cost" shows a value of 17300 R'000. This seems to be the closest match to "Contractor costs" mentioned in the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the value of 17300 R'000 for "- Current service cost" in the third table is the closest approximation to "Contractor costs" in the income statement for the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '4881990.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:20:22.665 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table for the year 2021:

| All amounts in R'O00       | Land, Buildings and Land Improvements   |   Furniture and Equipment |   Computers and Hardware | Motor Vehicles   | Assets Under Construction   |   Total |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| Zero book value adjustment | –                                       |                     39118 |                     3495 | –                | –                           |   42613 |
| Cost 31 December 2020      | 2966908                                 |                   1319099 |                   462278 | 53618            | 80087                       | 4881990 |

For the year 2021, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement is not explicitly provided in this table. The only relevant information is the Cost as of 31 December 2020, which is 4881990.

Therefore, based on the information provided in this table, we cannot determine the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No
