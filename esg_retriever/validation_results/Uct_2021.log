The table provided does not explicitly state the GHG Scope 1 emissions for the year 2021. It mentions different source categories and explanations related to emissions, but it does not provide a specific value or data point for the GHG Scope 1 emissions in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the specific question "What was the GHG Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021?" cannot be found in the given markdown table.

The table provided only mentions the Source Categories and their explanations, along with the boundary years of 2020 and 2021. It does not explicitly state the GHG Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:52:39.229 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provided does not contain any information about GHG Scope 1 emissions or GHG Scope 2 emissions specifically for the year 2021. It only mentions general categories of emissions without specifying the actual values for the emissions in 2021. Therefore, the specific answer to the question regarding the total GHG Scope 1 emissions + GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021 cannot be found in the given context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:52:53.723 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provided only includes data for Fugitive Emissions and Stationary Combustion for the years 2012 to 2021. It does not provide the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) for the year 2021. To calculate the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) for 2021, you would need data for all relevant scopes and sources, which are not present in the given table.

Conclusion:
No.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:52:55.423 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provided does not contain any information about the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021. It only mentions two source categories related to GHG emissions without specifying any numerical values or totals. Therefore, the specific question about the Total Absolute GHG emissions in 2021 cannot be answered directly from the given table.

No.

The specific question asks for the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021. However, the provided markdown table does not contain any information related to Advisory fees.

Explanation:
The provided markdown table does not contain any information related to the area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021. The table primarily discusses location, source category, and explanations related to fugitive emissions, which are not directly linked to the area of forestland with protected conservation status. Therefore, the specific answer to the question regarding the area of forestland with protected conservation status in 2021 cannot be found in the given context.

Answer:

Explanation:
The table provided only shows the number of training hours for part-time workers and students in the years 2021 and 2020. It does not provide the average hours of training for the year 2021. To calculate the average hours of training in 2021, you would need additional information such as the total number of part-time workers and students in 2021, and then divide the total training hours by the total number of individuals to get the average. Since this information is not provided in the table, the exact answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Looking at the provided markdown table, it only shows the procurement spend for two entities - Development Bank of South Africa and Sunlyn. However, the table does not provide a breakdown of the procurement spend based on the categories specified in the question (EMEs, QSEs, Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned).

Since the table does not provide the specific breakdown of the procurement spend as required by the question, the answer to the question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Are you sure that '-100689.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:56:33.340 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table, the Cost of sales for the year 2021 is provided as (100 689) for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd. This means that the Cost of sales for the year 2021 is actually -100,689 R'000 for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd.

For the second table, the Cost of sales for the year 2021 is also provided as (100 689) for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd. This confirms that the Cost of sales for the year 2021 is indeed -100,689 R'000 for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021?" is yes.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

No calculations will be required to answer the question - the answer, if it exists, will be directly retrievable from the context.
If the answer is not directly retrievable from the context, your conclusion should be 'no'.
Think step by step, and explain your reasoning.
Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.
Before concluding 'yes', please double-check that the answer to the EXACT question is directly available in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:57:22.136 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: Based on the provided markdown table, there is no direct mention or information related to the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021. The table primarily focuses on the University Audit and Risk Committee, internal administration, operational structures, and the areas of focus of the committee. Since the specific discussion regarding accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks is not mentioned in the table, the answer to the question cannot be found in this context.
