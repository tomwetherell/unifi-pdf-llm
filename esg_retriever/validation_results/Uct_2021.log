Are you sure that '97522.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:47.460 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. **Table 1:**
   - The table provides the Depreciation expense of right-of-use assets for both 2021 and 2020.
   - The Depreciation expense for 2021 is 97522.
   - Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is indeed 97522.

2. **Table 2:**
   - The table provides information about the Cost and Accumulated depreciation for 2020.
   - There is no specific information provided for 2021 in this table.
   - Since the question is about the year 2021, this table does not impact the answer.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table provides information about Current service cost and (Gains)/losses in the statement of other comprehensive income for both 2021 and 2020.
   - The Current service cost for 2021 is 17300.
   - Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021?" is **yes**.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:51.122 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the total employee wages and benefits for the year 2021.

1. From the first table:
   - Short-term employee benefits in 2021: 52790
   - Post-employment benefits in 2021: 8718
   - Total employee benefits in 2021: 52790 + 8718 = 61508

2. From the second table:
   - Wages and salaries for Academic Professionals in 2021: 1476469
   - Termination benefits in 2021: 13583
   - Total employee wages and benefits in 2021: 1476469 + 13583 = 1490052

Therefore, the total employee wages and benefits in the year 2021 is 1490052 + 61508 = 1551560.

The correct answer to the question "What was the Employee wages and benefits in the year 2021?" is not 3462770.0.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:50:55.688 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, we can see that the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.

Are you sure that '183547.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Revenue in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:06.076 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the revenue for the year 2021 is given as 2775542 R'000, and for the year 2020, it is 2024664 R'000. Therefore, the revenue for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 183547 R'000 in this table.

In the second table, the revenue for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 183547 R'000 for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd. However, this value is specific to UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd and not the total revenue for the year 2021.

In conclusion, the revenue for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 183547 R'000 in the tables provided.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:09.557 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - Closing balance for 2021 R'000 - Contract Assets is 9367.
   - This table does not provide the total assets for 2021.

2. In the second table:
   - Opening balance for 2021 R'000 - Contract Assets is 15784.
   - This table provides the total assets for 2021.

3. In the third table:

   - Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of employees for 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, none of them explicitly state the total number of employees for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '35709.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total number of employees in the year 2021?"

**Conclusion: No**

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:19.591 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

Table 1:
- GHG Scope 1 emissions are not explicitly provided for the year 2021.
- GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 are given as 16.

Table 2:
- GHG Scope 3 emissions are not relevant to the question.
- Construction emissions are not relevant to the question.

Table 3:
- GHG Scope 1 emissions (Direct / on-site) for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided.
- GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 are given as "Scope 2".

Based on the information provided in the tables, we do not have the GHG Scope 1 emissions for the year 2021 in any of the tables. Therefore, we cannot calculate the sum of GHG Scope 1 and GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:26.277 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. In the first table:
   - There is no information about GHG Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.
   - The table does not provide data for the year 2021.
   - The table does not contain information on revenue.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 in this table.

2. In the second table:
   - There is no information about GHG Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.
   - The table does not provide data for the year 2021.
   - The table does not contain information on revenue.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 in this table.

3. In the third table:
   - The table provides data for the year 2021.
   - The GHG Intensity (GHG Scope 1 + Scope 2 per Revenue) for the year 2021 can be calculated using the provided data.
   - The GHG Intensity value for the year 2021 is not explicitly given in the table.
   - The GHG Intensity value for the year 2021 can be calculated by dividing the total GHG emissions for Scope 1 & 2 by the revenue for the year 2021.
   - The GHG Intensity value for the year 2021 is not 12.0 based on the provided data.

Conclusion: No, 12.0 is not the correct answer to the question regarding the GHG Intensity for the year 2021 based on the information provided in the tables.

Are you sure that '29696.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:31.225 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - There is no information provided for the Total Absolute GHG emissions in the year 2021 in this table. The values mentioned are specific to different categories within the scope.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions for 2021 from Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - Similar to Table 1, there is no information provided for the Total Absolute GHG emissions in the year 2021 in this table. The values mentioned are specific to different categories within the scope.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions for 2021 from Table 2.

3. Table 3:
   - The row "Sub-Total Scope 3" provides the Total Absolute GHG emissions for the year 2021, which is 29696.
   - However, this value is specific to Scope 3 emissions and does not include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
   - Therefore, the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021 cannot be determined from Table 3 alone.

Conclusion: No, based on the provided tables, we cannot confirm that '29696.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021?"

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

This row does not provide information on CO emissions specifically, so we cannot determine the CO emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, for the year 2021, the only relevant row is "5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions | 15". Again, this row does not specify CO emissions, so we cannot determine the CO emissions for the year 2021 from this table either.

Moving on to the third table, for the year 2021, the relevant row is "5.3 | Refrigerant Gas Emissions | 14". This row also does not provide information on CO emissions, so we cannot determine the CO emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we do not have a specific value for CO emissions in the year 2021. The answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:52.548 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021 is explicitly mentioned.

1. Table 1:
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The rows provided are for 5.3 and 5.4, which are Refrigerant Gas Emissions and Stationary Combustion Emissions, respectively. There is no information about NOx emissions for the year 2021 in this table.

2. Table 2:
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The rows provided are for 5.4 (Stationary Combustion Emissions) and 6 (Scope 2). There is no information about NOx emissions for the year 2021 in this table.

3. Table 3:
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The rows provided are for 4 (Results Summary) and 4.1 (Absolute Emissions). There is no information about NOx emissions for the year 2021 in this table.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis of all three tables, none of them provide information about the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:51:57.087 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the provided markdown tables, we can see that the table structures are consistent with three separate tables, each containing different sections related to emissions data. 

For the first table:
- There is no specific information related to SOx emissions for the year 2021. The only relevant information is about Absolute Emissions, which is not directly related to SOx.

For the second table:
- There is no mention of SOx emissions for the year 2021. The data provided is about Refrigerant Gas Emissions and Stationary Combustion Emissions.

For the third table:
- There is no information about SOx emissions for the year 2021. The data presented is about Stationary Combustion Emissions and Scope 2 emissions.

Based on the analysis of the tables, none of the tables provide information about SOx emissions specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Air emissions of SOx for the year 2021 based on the given tables.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '11.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (4) particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:01.393 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the only relevant row is "Stationary Combustion Emissions" with a value of 15. Therefore, the value of 11.0 for particulate matter (PM10) emissions in the year 2021 is not correct based on this table.

Moving on to the second table, for the year 2021, the only relevant row is "Absolute Emissions" with a value of 11. This table does not provide information on particulate matter (PM10) emissions specifically.

Lastly, in the third table, for the year 2021, the only relevant row is "Stationary Combustion Emissions" with a value of 15. This table also does not provide information on particulate matter (PM10) emissions specifically.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the value of 11.0 for particulate matter (PM10) emissions in the year 2021 is not supported.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:06.333 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Year in question: 2021
   - Relevant row: 5.3 | Refrigerant Gas Emissions | 14
   - VOCs are not specifically mentioned in this row, so we cannot determine the emissions of VOCs for the year 2021 from this table.

2. Table 2:
   - Year in question: 2021
   - Relevant row: 5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions | 15
   - VOCs are not mentioned in this row, so we cannot determine the emissions of VOCs for the year 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - Year in question: 2021
   - Relevant row: Not applicable as there is no data for the year 2021 in this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, none of the tables provide information on the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:11.543 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first markdown table, the Expenses in the income statement for the year 2021 is given as 81900 R'000. This includes the item "Interest on obligation" which is a component of the total expenses.

In the second markdown table, there is no specific mention of ALL Administration expenses for the year 2021. The table provides information on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, but it does not directly state the ALL Administration expenses.

In the third markdown table, again there is no mention of ALL Administration expenses for the year 2021. The table provides information on the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Fund Balances, but it does not provide the specific ALL Administration expenses figure.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively confirm that 81900.0 is the correct answer to the question regarding the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:16.709 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the amount of assets under management by asset class is explicitly stated for the year 2021 as 360,307 R'000. This corresponds to the Right-of-use assets.

In the third table, the amount of assets under management by asset class is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

Based on the information provided in the second table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021?" is 360,307 R'000.

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

1. **Table 1:**
   - Income from subleasing right-of-use assets in 2021: (130)
   - Depreciation expense of right-of-use assets in 2021: 97522

   There is no specific information related to the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in this table for the year 2021.

2. **Table 2:**
   - No financial information is provided in this table. It lists abbreviations related to Capex.

3. **Table 3:**
   - No financial information is provided in this table. It lists abbreviations related to Capex.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, there is no information available to determine the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:24.895 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the one with Capex information, there is no mention of assets under management or integration of environmental, social, and governance issues. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management that employ integration of ESG issues from this table.

Moving on to the third table, which includes information about Property, plant and equipment and Right-of-use assets, we can see that the row corresponding to Right-of-use assets provides the values for the year 2021 and 2020. The amount for 2021 is 360,307 R'000. However, this table does not mention anything about the integration of environmental, social, and governance issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:28.834 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific information provided for the amount of assets under management related to social issues for the year 2021. The table only includes information on income from subleasing right-of-use assets and depreciation expense of right-of-use assets.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no mention of the amount of assets under management related to social issues for the year 2021. The table includes details about right-of-use assets and investments.

Finally, in the third table, the row for "ASSETS" does provide the total amount of assets for the year 2021, which is 15,634,720. However, this table does not specify the breakdown of assets by asset class that employ social issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '360307.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:32.988 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of right-of-use assets in 2021 is 360,307 R'000. However, this table does not specify if these assets employ sustainability themed investing.

Moving on to the second table, the investments in 2021 amount to 8,932,003 R'000. Again, this table does not provide information on sustainability themed investing.

Lastly, in the third table, the right-of-use assets in 2021 are also stated as 360,307 R'000. Similar to the first table, there is no mention of sustainability themed investing.

Based on the information provided in the tables, none of them explicitly state the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:36.588 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, we can see that the row for "Right-of-use assets" provides the values for both 2021 and 2020. In 2021, the amount for Right-of-use assets is 360,307 R'000. This means that the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed screening in the year 2021 is indeed 360,307 R'000.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '1384.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:45.708 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for "Waste Generated in Operations" shows that the volume of waste generated in 2021 was 1384 tonnes. However, this table does not provide specific information about the volume of waste sent for recycling or food waste recovered in 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that 1384 tonnes is the correct answer to the question about the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '456000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

Therefore, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in 2021 based on this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided under "2021 R'000 - Land, - Buildings and Land Improvements" is 456. This value does not seem to represent the area of forestland owned, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2020, there is no specific value provided for the area of forestland owned. Therefore, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in 2021 based on this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '456.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:54.948 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no specific information provided about the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

2. In the second table, there is also no mention of the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table either.

3. In the third table, the row "Additions" shows a value of 456 for the "2021 R'000 - Land, - Buildings and Land Improvements". This value could potentially represent the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the third table, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021?" is '456.0'.

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:52:59.395 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. In the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100% for both R Morar and B Mtsi.

2. In the second table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100% for both B Mtsi and R Muloiwa.

3. In the third table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100% for both P Ntentema and N Ntusi.

Based on the information provided in each table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is consistently 100% across all three tables. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?" is '100.0'.

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:53:12.252 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - There is no explicit mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in this table for the year 2021. The only information provided is related to residence tiers, student capacity, and bookings. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level from this table for the year 2021.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Similar to Table 1, there is no mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in this table for the year 2021. The information provided is about residence tiers, types of students, capacity, and bookings. Hence, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level from this table for the year 2021.

3. **Table 3:**
   - This table provides information about financial data related to money market deposits and unlisted entities. There is no mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in this table for the year 2021. The focus is on financial figures rather than B-BBEE Scorecard Level.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, none of them provide information about the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." cannot be determined from the given tables.

**Conclusion:** No

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:53:20.287 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. For the first table:
   - The year 2021 is explicitly mentioned.
   - The % Attendance for both individuals is 100.
   - Therefore, the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is indeed 100%.

2. For the second table:
   - The year 2021 is explicitly mentioned.
   - The % Attendance for both individuals is 100.
   - Therefore, the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is indeed 100%.

3. For the third table:
   - The year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned for either individual.
   - The % Attendance for both individuals is 0%.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is 100% for the first two tables. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '81900.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:53:25.693 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Expenses in the income statement for 2021: 81900 R'000
   - Interest on obligation for 2021: 64600 R'000

2. **Table 2:**
   - Expense relating to leases of low-value assets for 2021: 2548 R'000
   - Total amount recognised in profit or loss for 2021: 131871 R'000

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The values provided in the tables do not directly correspond to Contractor costs. Therefore, we cannot determine the Contractor costs per income statement for 2021 from the given tables.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:53:40.048 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Table 1:
- Current service cost for 2021: 17300
- (Gains)/losses in the statement of other comprehensive income for 2021: 26200

There is no explicit mention of the Cost relating to acquisition in Table 1 for the year 2021.

Table 2:
- Expense relating to leases of low-value assets for 2021: 2548
- Total amount recognised in profit or loss for 2021: 131871

The Expense relating to leases of low-value assets is not the Cost relating to acquisition. Therefore, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in Table 2.

Table 3:
- Net finance costs for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd in 2021: (4 274)
- Profit/(loss) before tax for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd in 2021: 5127

There is no mention of the Cost relating to acquisition in Table 3 for the year 2021.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated.
