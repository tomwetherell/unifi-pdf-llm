Answer:

2024-03-06 23:42:46.328 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. Table 1:
   - The Depreciation expense of right-of-use assets for 2021 is given as 97522.
   - Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is indeed 97522.

2. Table 2:
   - The Accumulated depreciation for Land, Buildings, and Land Improvements for 2020 is not provided.
   - We cannot determine the Depreciation as per income statement for 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - The Current service cost for 2021 is given as 17300.
   - Therefore, the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

Based on the analysis of each table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021?" is 'Yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:42:59.521 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table, there is no information provided for GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021. The last row in the table pertains to Scope 2 emissions, not Scope 3 emissions for 2021. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the GHG Scope 3 emissions in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second markdown table, again, there is no information provided for GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021. The last row in this table pertains to Construction Emissions, not Scope 3 emissions for 2021. Therefore, it is also not possible to determine the GHG Scope 3 emissions in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third markdown table, the row labeled "Sub-Total Scope 3" provides the information for GHG Scope 3 emissions in both 2020 and 2021. The value for 2021 is given as 29696, which indicates the GHG Scope 3 emissions for that year.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is 'yes'.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '183547.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Revenue in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:43:05.986 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the revenue for the year 2021 is 2775542 R'000, not 183547 R'000.

In the second table, the revenue for the year 2021 is 183547 R'000, which is correct.

In the third table, the revenue for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Revenue in the year 2021?" is '183547.0' based on the second table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '9367.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:43:12.148 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table, for the year 2021:
   - Closing balance for Contract Assets: 9367
   - Closing balance for Contract Liabilities: (68 635)
   
   The total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021 would be the sum of Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities, which is 9367 - 68 635 = -59,268. This negative value indicates a deficit in assets compared to liabilities.

2. In the second table, for the year 2021:
   - Opening balance for Contract Assets: 15784
   - Opening balance for Contract Liabilities: (43 474)
   
   The total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021 would be the sum of Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities, which is 15784 - 43 474 = -27,690. This negative value also indicates a deficit in assets compared to liabilities.

3. In the third table, for the year 2021:
   - Amounts received for Contract Assets: 8595
   - Amounts received for Contract Liabilities: 89882
   
   The total assets as per the balance sheet in the year 2021 would be the sum of Amounts received for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities, which is 8595 - 89882 = -81,287. This negative value indicates a deficit in assets compared to liabilities.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total assets as per balance sheet in the year 2021?" is **No**. The total assets in all three cases for the year 2021 show a deficit compared to liabilities.

Conclusion: No.

Table 1:
- GHG Scope 1 emissions are not explicitly mentioned in this table for the year 2021.
- GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 are given as 16.
- Therefore, we cannot calculate the sum of GHG Scope 1 and GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Table 2:
- GHG Scope 1 emissions are not provided in this table for the year 2021.
- GHG Scope 2 emissions are not mentioned in this table for the year 2021.
- Therefore, we cannot calculate the sum of GHG Scope 1 and GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Table 3:
- GHG Scope 1 emissions are not mentioned in this table for the year 2021.
- GHG Scope 2 emissions are not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table.
- Therefore, we cannot calculate the sum of GHG Scope 1 and GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:43:34.421 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - There is no information provided for the Total Absolute GHG emissions in the year 2021 in this table. The values mentioned are specific to different categories within the scope.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions for 2021 from Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - Similar to Table 1, there is no information provided for the Total Absolute GHG emissions in the year 2021 in this table. The values mentioned are specific to different categories within the scope.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions for 2021 from Table 2.

3. Table 3:
   - In Table 3, the Total Absolute GHG emissions for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The table only shows the breakdown of emissions by different sources and their percentages.
   - The values mentioned in this table do not directly give us the Total Absolute GHG emissions for 2021.
   
Based on the analysis of the provided tables, we cannot determine the Total Absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 - 3) in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:43:47.054 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the answer to the question about the Advisory fees in the year 2021.

1. **Table 1:**
   - Expenses in the income statement for 2021: 81900
   - Interest on obligation for 2021: 64600

   There is no explicit mention of Advisory fees in this table for the year 2021.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Management fee received for 2021: 3957

   The Management fee received is not the same as Advisory fees. Therefore, this value does not represent the Advisory fees for 2021.

3. **Table 3:**
   - Unutilised funds reinvested for 2021: (40 228)
   - Management fee received for 2021: 3957

   Similar to Table 2, the Management fee received is not the same as Advisory fees. Therefore, this value does not represent the Advisory fees for 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, there is no explicit mention of Advisory fees for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:43:58.531 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

|   1 | Executive Summary               |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------------------|------|
| 5.3 | Refrigerant Gas Emissions       |   14 |
| 5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions |   15 |

The table does not provide information about NOx emissions for the year 2021. The values provided are for Refrigerant Gas Emissions and Stationary Combustion Emissions, not NOx emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the NOx emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table:

|   1 | Executive Summary               |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------------------|------|
| 5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions |   15 |
| 6   | Scope 2                         |   16 |

Similarly, this table also does not provide information about NOx emissions for the year 2021. The values provided are for Stationary Combustion Emissions and Scope 2, not NOx emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the NOx emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Finally, looking at the third table:

|   1 | Executive Summary   |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------|------|
| 4   | Results Summary     |   11 |
| 4.1 | Absolute Emissions  |   11 |

This table also does not provide information about NOx emissions for the year 2021. The values provided are for Results Summary and Absolute Emissions, not NOx emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the NOx emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:05.552 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 is explicitly mentioned:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The only years mentioned are 5.3 and 5.4.
   - The value for particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 is not provided in this table.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The only year mentioned is 4.
   - The value for particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 is not provided in this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - Year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The only years mentioned are 5.4 and 6.
   - The value for particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 is not provided in this table.

Based on the analysis of all three tables, none of them provide the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is **'No'**.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:12.173 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

|   1 | Executive Summary               |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------------------|------|
| 5.3 | Refrigerant Gas Emissions       |   14 |
| 5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions |   15 |

For the year in question (2021), there is no specific information provided for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. The table only mentions emissions related to Refrigerant Gas and Stationary Combustion. Therefore, we cannot determine the VOCs emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table:

|   1 | Executive Summary               |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------------------|------|
| 5.4 | Stationary Combustion Emissions |   15 |
| 6   | Scope 2                         |   16 |

Again, for the year 2021, there is no specific information provided for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. The table mentions emissions related to Stationary Combustion but not VOCs. Therefore, we cannot determine the VOCs emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table:

|   1 | Executive Summary         |   .5 |
|-----|---------------------------|------|
| 5.2 | Vehicle Fleet Emissions   |   14 |
| 5.3 | Refrigerant Gas Emissions |   14 |

Once more, for the year 2021, there is no specific information provided for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. The table mentions emissions related to Vehicle Fleet and Refrigerant Gas but not VOCs. Therefore, we cannot determine the VOCs emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021 were 15.0.

Are you sure that '360307.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:20.407 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, we can see that the amount of right-of-use assets in 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management for this asset class in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the amount of right-of-use assets in 2021 is given as 360,307. This corresponds to the amount of assets under management for this asset class in 2021.

In the third table, the total assets in 2021 are provided as 15,634,720, but this does not specify the amount for the right-of-use assets specifically.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021?" is **No**.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:24.989 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine if '360307.0' is the correct answer to the question based on this table.

Looking at the second table, there is no relevant information provided to answer the question about the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues.

Finally, in the third table, the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues is not explicitly stated for the year 2021. The value of '360307.0' corresponds to the year 2020, not 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '360307.0' is the correct answer to the question for the year 2021.

However, this table does not provide information specifically about assets under management that employ sustainability themed investing.

Moving on to the second table, the amount of right-of-use assets in 2021 is also 360,307 R'000. Again, this table does not mention assets under management related to sustainability themed investing.

Finally, in the third table, the amount of right-of-use assets in 2021 is once again 360,307 R'000. This table does mention property, plant, and equipment, but it does not provide information on assets under management related to sustainability themed investing.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '360307.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed screening in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:34.753 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, we can see that the row for "Right-of-use assets" provides the values for both 2021 and 2020. The amount for 2021 is 360,307 R'000. However, this does not represent the amount of assets under management that employ sustainability themed screening. This value specifically refers to the Right-of-use assets and not assets under management with sustainability themed screening.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed screening in the year 2021?" based on the provided tables is **no**.

From the table, we can see that the amount of contract liabilities utilized in 2021 is (115 043) R'000. This means that R'115,043,000 was utilized in 2021. 

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" based on this table is **R'115,043,000**.

Are you sure that '1384.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:44.659 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 for "Waste Generated in Operations" shows a value of 1384 tonnes of CO2e. However, this table does not provide the specific volume of waste sent for recycling or food waste recovered in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 for "Waste Generated in Operations" shows a value of 1384 tonnes of CO2e. Again, this table does not provide the specific volume of waste sent for recycling or food waste recovered in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we also cannot determine the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, we cannot determine the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Therefore, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in 2021 based on this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided under "2021 R'000 - Land, - Buildings and Land Improvements" is 456. This value does not seem to represent the area of forestland owned, as it is significantly lower than the values typically associated with land areas. 

Looking at the third table for the year 2020, there is no specific value provided for the area of forestland owned. 

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '456.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:52.943 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no specific information provided about the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

2. In the second table, there is also no mention of the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table either.

3. In the third table, the row "Additions" shows a value of 456 for the "2021 R'000 - Land, - Buildings and Land Improvements". This value could potentially represent the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the third table, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021?" is '456.0'.

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:44:59.311 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

| 2021    | 13 Mar   | 19 Jun   | 16 Oct   | 4 Dec   |   % Attendance |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| R Morar | P        | P        | P        | P       |            100 |
| B Mtsi  | N/A      | N/A      | P        | P       |            100 |

The Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100 for both members listed in the table.

Looking at the second table:

| 2021      | 13 Mar   | 19 Jun   | 16 Oct   | 4 Dec   |   % Attendance |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| B Mtsi    | N/A      | N/A      | P        | P       |            100 |
| R Muloiwa | P        | P        | P        | P       |            100 |

Similarly, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100 for both members listed in this table as well.

Lastly, examining the third table:

| 2021       | 13 Mar   | 19 Jun   | 16 Oct   | 4 Dec   |   % Attendance |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| P Ntentema | P        | P        | P        | N/A     |            100 |
| N Ntusi    | P        | P        | P        | P       |            100 |

Once again, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100 for all members listed in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in all three tables, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is consistently 100 for all members across the tables.

Yes.

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:45:11.128 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - There is no explicit mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021 in this table. The only information provided is related to residence tiers, student categories, capacity, and bookings. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level from this table for the year 2021.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Similar to Table 1, there is no mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021 in this table. The data in this table pertains to residence tiers, student categories, capacity, and bookings. Hence, we cannot ascertain the B-BBEE Scorecard Level from this table for the year 2021.

3. **Table 3:**
   - This table provides information on financial figures related to money market deposits and unlisted entities. There is no mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in this table. The data presented here does not include any details about the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021.

Based on the analysis of the three tables provided, none of them contain information regarding the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." cannot be determined from the tables provided.

**Conclusion:** No

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:45:17.111 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. For the first table:
   - The year 2021 is represented with columns for 13 Mar, 19 Jun, 16 Oct, and 4 Dec.
   - The % Attendance for the year 2021 is explicitly provided for both individuals, and it is 100% for both.

2. For the second table:
   - The year 2021 is represented with columns for 13 Mar, 19 Jun, 16 Oct, and 4 Dec.
   - The % Attendance for the year 2021 is explicitly provided for both individuals, and it is 100% for both.

3. For the third table:
   - The year 2021 is represented with columns for 26 Feb, 12 Mar, 4 Jun, and 19 Nov.
   - The % Attendance for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided for either individual. Instead, it shows 'N/A' or 'Ab' for all dates in 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is indeed 100% for all individuals mentioned in the first two tables. However, the third table does not provide explicit attendance rates for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?" based on the information in the tables is 'Yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:45:27.085 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Current service cost for 2021: 17300
   - There is no specific mention of Corporate office costs in this table for 2021.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Expenses in the income statement for 2021: 81900
   - Interest on obligation for 2021: 64600
   - There is no specific mention of Corporate office costs in this table for 2021.

3. **Table 3:**
   - Expense relating to leases of low-value assets for 2021: 2548
   - Total amount recognized in profit or loss for 2021: 131871
   - There is no specific mention of Corporate office costs in this table for 2021.

Based on the provided tables, there is no direct mention of Corporate office costs for the year 2021. Therefore, the value of '17300.0' cannot be confirmed as the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '100689000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:45:30.259 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Cost of sales for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd is given as (100 689) R'000. The value provided in the table is in brackets, indicating a negative value. Therefore, the correct Cost of sales for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd in 2021 is -100,689 R'000, not 100,689 R'000.

So, the answer to the question "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021?" is no.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:45:34.960 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Expense relating to leases of low-value assets: 2548 R'000
   - Total amount recognised in profit or loss: 131871 R'000

2. **Table 2:**
   - There is no information related to the cost of acquisition in this table for the year 2021.

3. **Table 3:**
   - Net finance costs for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd: (4 274) R'000
   - Net finance costs for Hyplat (Pty) Ltd: -
   - Profit before tax for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd: 5127 R'000
   - Profit before tax for Hyplat (Pty) Ltd: (3 109) R'000

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I cannot confirm that 131871.0 is the correct answer to the question without further information.
