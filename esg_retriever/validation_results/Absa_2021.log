Since the age group 40-49 falls within the range of 40 to 49 years, we can infer that the average age for this group would be around 45-46 years. Therefore, the value under the "2021" column in the "Average age" row should give us the average age for the 40-49 age group in the year 2021.

In this case, the value under the "2021" column in the "Average age" row is 60. This value does not represent the average age of the 40-49 age group in the year 2021. Hence, the answer is 'no'.

1. Average age for the age group 40-49 years in 2021: From the table, the average age for the age group 40-49 years in 2021 is 3.

2. Total number of individuals aged 40-49 years in 2021: The trend value for the age group 40-49 years in 2021 is 3.

3. Total age contributed by individuals aged 40-49 years in 2021: Average age * Total number of individuals = 3 * 3 = 9.

4. Total number of individuals aged 50+ in 2021: Since the average age for the overall population in 2021 is given as 60, we can assume that the average age for individuals aged 50+ is also 60.

5. Total age contributed by individuals aged 50+ in 2021: Total number of individuals aged 50+ * Average age = Total number of individuals aged 50+ * 60.

6. To find the average age of individuals aged 50+ in 2021, we need to calculate the total age contributed by individuals aged 50+ in 2021 and then divide it by the total number of individuals aged 50+.

Explanation:
1. The question is asking for the Fatal-injury frequency rate in the year 2021.
2. In the table, under the "Indicator" column, we can see the specific indicator "Fatal-injury frequency rate (number of fatalities per 200 000 person hours worked)" listed.
3. The table also has columns for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
4. The value for the Fatal-injury frequency rate for each year is indicated in the respective columns.
5. In this case, we are interested in the value for the year 2021, which is the third column in the table.
6. Since the table provides the Fatal-injury frequency rate for each year, we can find the answer to the question directly from the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the provided markdown table.

The row that contains the information for the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked) is the closest match to what we are looking for.

In the year 2021, the Lost-time injury frequency rate was 0.06. This rate represents the number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked. However, this rate is not the same as the Fatal-injury frequency rate, which specifically refers to the number of fatalities per 200,000 person hours worked.

Therefore, the information we need to answer the question is not explicitly provided in this table. We cannot determine the Fatal-injury frequency rate for the year 2021 based on the data presented in this table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:46:36.817 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Fatal-injury frequency rate in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Lost-time injury frequency rate" row in the table. The Fatal-injury frequency rate is not explicitly mentioned in the table, but we can calculate it using the formula:

Fatal-injury frequency rate = (Number of fatalities / Total person hours worked) * 200,000

Since the table provides the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked), we cannot directly determine the Fatal-injury frequency rate without additional information on the number of fatalities.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the given markdown table.

year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:47:37.657 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 249.5 for General waste (landfill), but this may not specifically represent the Waste to landfill for that year.

Looking at the second table, the Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided either. The value for 2021 is given as 249.5 for General waste (landfill), but again, this may not specifically represent the Waste to landfill for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that '249.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the year 2021?".

The indicator that seems most relevant to this question is "Number of trade unions" as it may indicate the presence of unions that cover staff through collective bargaining agreements.

Looking at the data under the "Number of trade unions" column, we can see that in the year 2021, there were 15 trade unions. This number does not directly provide the percentage of staff covered by unions or collective bargaining agreements. However, it does give us an idea that there were multiple trade unions in place during that year, which could potentially cover a significant percentage of staff through collective bargaining agreements.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the exact percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:48:41.060 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Employee diversity (%) - Women in junior, middle, and senior leadership in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of women in each leadership level based on the total number of women employees in that year.

1. Calculate the percentage of women in junior leadership in 2021:
   - Total women employees in 2021: 60.9
   - Women in senior leadership in 2021: 35
   - Women in junior leadership = Total women employees - Women in senior leadership
   - Women in junior leadership = 60.9 - 35 = 25.9
   - Percentage of women in junior leadership = (Women in junior leadership / Total women employees) * 100
   - Percentage of women in junior leadership = (25.9 / 60.9) * 100 ≈ 42.5%

2. Calculate the percentage of women in middle leadership in 2021:
   - Since the table does not provide direct data on women in middle leadership, we cannot calculate this percentage.

3. Calculate the percentage of women in senior leadership in 2021:
   - Given data: Women in senior leadership in 2021 = 35
   - Percentage of women in senior leadership = (Women in senior leadership / Total women employees) * 100
   - Percentage of women in senior leadership = (35 / 60.9) * 100 ≈ 57.4%

Therefore, the Employee diversity (%) - Women in junior, middle, and senior leadership in the year 2021 can be calculated for junior and senior leadership but not for middle leadership based on the provided table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:49:00.966 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021, we need to look at the row that corresponds to this specific indicator in the table. 

The row that is closest to this indicator in the table is "Total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies (Rbn)". However, this row specifically mentions companies that are >51% black-owned, which is not the same as >30% black-owned companies.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:49:53.637 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in the year 2021, we need to multiply the Average hours training per person by the Number of programmes accessed for that year.

From the table:
- Average hours training per person in 2021 is 55.33
- Number of programmes accessed in 2021 is 7294

To calculate the Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in 2021:
Total hours = Average hours training per person * Number of programmes accessed
Total hours = 55.33 * 7294 = 403,648.02

Therefore, the Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in the year 2021 is approximately 403,648.02.

2024-03-09 14:49:56.809 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in the year 2021, we need to look at the column "2021 - programmes - Number of utilised" and the corresponding column "2021 - Training - hours" in the table.

The Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in the year 2021 can be calculated by summing the "2021 - Training - hours" for both "Training" and "Programmes" categories.

From the table:
- For Training in 2021: 961,865 hours
- For Programmes in 2021: 3,961 hours

Therefore, the Total hours for programmes accessed (m) in the year 2021 is 961,865 + 3,961 = 965,826 hours.

Are you sure that '16.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:50:08.842 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is given as 16.3. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) in the year 2021?" is '16.3'.

Looking at the second table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year from the second table.

However, this value does not directly give us the total number of board members in 2021. It only tells us the number of women board members. To determine the total number of board members, we would need additional information such as the total board size or the percentage of women on the board.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of board members in the year 2021?" cannot be directly found in the provided markdown table.

Therefore, to find the average hours of training per person in 2021, we would calculate:

Average hours of training per person in 2021 = Total hours of video training in 2021 / Total number of interventions in 2021
Average hours of training per person in 2021 = 35,801 / 384

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:51:49.863 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average training hours per person for Female in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total training hours for Female in 2021 and then divide it by the total number of Female employees who received training in 2021.

From the given table, we have the following information:
- Video training hours for Female in 2021: 35,801
- Number of interventions for Female in 2021: 384

To calculate the average training hours per person for Female in 2021, we need to divide the total training hours (35,801) by the total number of interventions (384).

Average training hours per person for Female in 2021 = 35,801 / 384 ≈ 93.23 hours

Therefore, the average training hours per person, by gender and by race, including compliance training - Female in the year 2021 is approximately 93.23 hours.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:51:56.278 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the total video training hours for that year is 35801 and the total number of video training interventions is 384.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:52:22.389 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the number of Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021, we need to look at the total number of non-executive directors in that year and then subtract the number of executive directors from that total.

In the provided table, the total number of non-executive directors in 2021 is given as 1, and the total number of executive directors in 2021 is given as 2.

To find the number of Independent non-executive directors in 2021, we can use the formula:
Independent non-executive directors = Total non-executive directors - Executive directors

Substitute the values:
Independent non-executive directors in 2021 = 1 (total non-executive directors) - 2 (executive directors) = -1

Since the result is a negative number, it indicates that there were no Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021 based on the information provided in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:52:59.537 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021, we need to look for the row in the table that specifically mentions carbon emissions. In this case, the row that contains information about carbon emissions is "Carbon emission per m2 of office space."

Looking at the data in the table, we can see that the values under the columns for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018 represent the carbon emission per square meter of office space for those respective years. However, this data does not directly provide the total carbon emissions in tonnes for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information available in the provided markdown table, we cannot directly determine the total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO_{2} ) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:53:02.201 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 187237. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?" is '187237.0'.

Looking at the second table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the value for the year 2021 from the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:54:01.661 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to look for the relevant data in the table. The closest indicator we have in the table is the "Lost-time injury frequency rate" which is given as "number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked" for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

To calculate the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for 2021, we need to convert the given rate of "number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked" to the desired rate of "Injuries/1m hrs worked". 

Given that the rate for 2021 is 0.06 (lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked), we can calculate the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021 by first converting 200,000 person hours to 1 million person hours (1m hrs = 1,000,000 hrs) and then adjusting the rate accordingly.

Therefore, the calculation would be:
All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for 2021 = (0.06 / 200,000) * 1,000,000 = 300 injuries per 1 million hours worked.

So, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is 300 injuries per 1 million hours worked in the year 2021.

2024-03-09 14:54:06.157 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this metric in the table. The indicator that closely matches this description is the "Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked) (Absa Regional Operations)." 

In the table, the values under this indicator for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are provided. The value for 2021 is 0.03, which represents the lost-time injury frequency rate for that year. 

Since the lost-time injury frequency rate is given per 200,000 person hours worked, we need to convert this to Injuries/1m hrs worked. To do this, we can calculate:

Injuries/1m hrs worked = (0.03 * 1,000,000) / 200,000 = 0.15

Therefore, the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021 is 0.15.

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:54:13.651 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table (South Africa), the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 0.06 for the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked), which is not the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate.

For the second table (Absa Regional Operations), the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 0.03 for the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked), which is not the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021.

| Regulatory fines (Rm) | 1       | 3.7    | 2.1    | 9.6    | 9.8    |

The amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 2.1. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" is '2.1'.

Now, looking at the second table:

| Regulatory fines (Rm)      | 1       |    3.7 |    2.1 |    9.6 | 9.8    |

The amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 2.1 in this table as well.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question based on both tables is '2.1'.

In this table, there are two categories: "Business area 1 to Business area 4" and "Non-corporate title." Since we are looking for the Area of forestland leased, we need to determine if either of these categories specifically refers to forestland.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:55:36.490 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021, we need to look at the values under the column for the year 2021 in the table. In this case, the values under the column for 2021 are 23.99 and 16.99. 

Since the question specifically asks for the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021, we can see that the values 23.99 and 16.99 represent the areas managed in 2021 for Business area 1 to Business area 4 and Non-corporate title, respectively. Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in this table.

Yes

Consider the following markdown tables:

|                                    |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |

| Non-corporate title                |  12.97 |  16.99 |   6.77 |  15.62 |

Are you sure that '23.99' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland managed by the entity in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:56:12.215 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average hours of training in the year 2021, we need to look at the row corresponding to "Video training (hours)" and the column corresponding to the year 2021. In this case, the value in the cell where these two intersect is 35801. This represents the total number of hours of video training in the year 2021.

To calculate the average hours of training in 2021, we would need additional information such as the total number of interventions or the total number of employees who received training in that year. Without this additional information, we cannot calculate the average hours of training in 2021 solely based on the provided table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:56:40.297 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021, we need to look at the "2021 - Training hours" column in the table. Specifically, we need to focus on the row that corresponds to anti-corruption issues. In this case, the relevant row is "Compliance."

From the table, we can see that the number of training hours on anti-corruption issues in 2021 for Compliance was 391666 hours.

To calculate the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021, we would simply take the value provided for 2021 and divide it by the number of programmes utilised in 2021 for Compliance, which is 463.

Therefore, the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021 for Compliance would be 391666 / 463 ≈ 846.33 hours.

So, yes, the answer to the question can be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:57:04.340 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers that comes from QSEs in 2021.

From the table, we see that the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021 was 16.3 Rbn.

To find the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs, we need additional information on the breakdown of this total spend between different types of B-BBEE-accredited suppliers, specifically QSEs. Since the table does not provide this breakdown or mention QSEs explicitly, we cannot determine the exact percentage of spend from QSEs in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:57:10.368 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the answer to the question, we need to calculate the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. 

From the table, we can see that the total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021 was 16.3 Rbn. This represents the total spend with BBBEE-accredited suppliers.

To calculate the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's, we need to find the total procurement spend in 2021. From the table, we see that the procurement spend with locally registered suppliers in 2021 was 16 Rbn.

Therefore, the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in 2021 can be calculated as follows:

(16.3 / 16) * 100 = 101.875%

So, the answer to the question is 101.875%. We do not need to include the word 'Level' in the answer.

In this table, the categories are African, Coloured, Indian, White, and Not disclosed.

Since the term "black" is not explicitly mentioned in the table, we need to infer which category represents black individuals. In South Africa, the term "black" is often used to refer to African, Coloured, and Indian individuals collectively. Therefore, to find the percentage of black board members, we need to sum the percentages of African, Coloured, and Indian board members for the year 2019.

Adding the percentages for African (47.79%), Coloured (48.51%), and Indian (36.64%) board members in 2019 gives us a total of 132.94%. This total exceeds 100%, indicating that the categories are not mutually exclusive and individuals can fall into more than one category.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:57:26.971 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021, we need to look at the following columns in the table:

- Female - African
- Female - Coloured
- Female - White
- Grand total

We can calculate the percentage by adding the number of Black female executive directors (Female - African + Female - Coloured) and dividing it by the total number of directors (Grand total).

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Black female executive directors = Female - African + Female - Coloured
   = 526 + 163
   = 689

2. Total number of directors = Grand total
   = 4178 + 7998
   = 12176

3. Percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors = (689 / 12176) * 100
   ≈ 5.66%

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is approximately 5.66%.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:57:31.608 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021, we need to look at the total number of female African Coloured White executive directors and the total number of all directors in the table.

From the table, we can see that the total number of female African Coloured White executive directors in the VP grade is 165 and in the AVP grade is 563. So, the total number of female African Coloured White executive directors in both grades is 165 + 563 = 728.

To find the total number of all directors, we need to sum up the total number of directors in each grade. The total number of directors in the VP grade is 1853 and in the AVP grade is 4448. So, the total number of all directors in both grades is 1853 + 4448 = 6301.

Now, to calculate the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors, we divide the total number of female African Coloured White executive directors by the total number of all directors and multiply by 100:

(728 / 6301) * 100 ≈ 11.55%

Therefore, the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021 is approximately 11.55%.

1. Identify the row that corresponds to executive directors: In the table, the rows represent different management levels. We are interested in the executive director level, so we need to find the row that contains this information.

2. Identify the columns for Black female executive directors: Once we have identified the row for executive directors, we need to locate the columns that represent Black female employees at the executive director level.

3. Calculate the percentage: After identifying the number of Black female executive directors, we can calculate the percentage by dividing this number by the total number of directors and multiplying by 100.

Based on the information provided in the table, we can follow these steps to determine the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '4.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Black female exec. directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:57:39.454 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: To find the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021, we need to look at the relevant row in each table and calculate the percentage based on the given data.

1. In the first table:
   - For the year 2021, the data for Black female executive directors is not explicitly provided in the row corresponding to executive directors. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage for this specific category in the year 2021.

2. In the second table:
   - For the year 2021, the data for Black female executive directors is explicitly provided in the row corresponding to executive directors. We can calculate the percentage for this specific category in the year 2021.

3. In the third table:
   - For the year 2021, the data for Black female executive directors is not explicitly provided in the row corresponding to executive directors. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage for this specific category in the year 2021.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021 is explicitly provided in the second table. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 14:58:09.200 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for the relevant information in the provided table. The Cost of sales is typically not directly listed in an income statement table, but it can be calculated using the information available.

The Cost of sales is usually calculated as the difference between the Revenue and the Gross Profit. In this table, we have the following relevant columns:
- Revenue less other income Rm
- Profit before tax Rm

To calculate the Cost of sales, we can use the formula:
Cost of sales = Revenue - Gross Profit

Gross Profit = Revenue - Profit before tax

Therefore, we can calculate the Cost of sales by subtracting the Gross Profit from the Revenue. However, since the table does not provide the Gross Profit directly, we cannot determine the Cost of sales from this table alone.

The cost related to acquisition is typically categorized under different headings such as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Operating Expenses, or other similar categories.

In the given table, we do not have a specific column labeled as "Cost relating to acquisition" or a similar heading that directly indicates the cost related to acquisition. However, we can look at certain columns that might contain relevant information:

1. "Tangible assets other than cash Rm": This column may include costs related to acquiring tangible assets other than cash. However, it may not represent the complete picture of acquisition costs.

2. "Revenue less other income Rm": This column represents the revenue after deducting other income. While this is not a direct indicator of acquisition costs, it can provide insights into the financial performance of the company.

3. "Profit before tax Rm": This column shows the profit generated before tax expenses. While not directly related to acquisition costs, it can give an overall view of the financial health of the company.

Without a specific column or heading indicating the Cost relating to acquisition, it is not possible to directly identify this information from the provided table. Additional details or a different table may be required to specifically pinpoint the acquisition costs.

2024-03-09 14:58:36.773 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific line item related to Depreciation in the table. Typically, Depreciation is a non-cash expense that is included in the income statement to reflect the decrease in value of tangible assets over time.

In the provided table, there is no specific column or entry that directly mentions Depreciation. However, Depreciation expenses are usually categorized under operating expenses or included in the calculation of Profit before tax. In this table, we can see the following relevant columns:

- Profit before tax Rm: This column represents the profit before tax, which may include various expenses, including Depreciation.
- Total tax expenditure Rm: This column shows the total tax expenditure, which may also indirectly reflect the impact of Depreciation on taxable income.

To determine the Depreciation amount, we would need more detailed information or a breakdown of the Profit before tax to identify if Depreciation is explicitly listed or if it is included in another category.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot definitively determine the Depreciation amount as per the income statement in the year 2021.

2024-03-09 14:58:52.423 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To answer the question about the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021, we need to analyze the information provided in the markdown table.

Looking at the table, we can see that it mentions aspects related to governance, such as the Board, Exco (Executive Committee), ethics, and remuneration. These governance factors are crucial in ESG considerations as they reflect how a company is managed and governed in terms of transparency, accountability, and ethical practices.

Additionally, the table also touches on environmental factors, specifically mentioning Equator Principles, REIPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement), and sustainable products. These environmental considerations are significant in ESG analysis as they assess a company's impact on the environment and its efforts towards sustainability.

However, the table does not explicitly mention social factors, which are also essential components of ESG analysis. Social factors typically include aspects related to human rights, labor practices, community engagement, diversity, and inclusion.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown table, we can infer some aspects of the approach to incorporating ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes in 2021, particularly focusing on governance and environmental factors. However, a comprehensive understanding of the social aspects of ESG would require additional information beyond what is presented in the table.

The indicators listed in the table are "Vote for proposed remuneration for non-executive directors (%)" and "Suspicious transactions."

Since the indicator we are looking for is related to the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery, it is unlikely to be directly related to remuneration for non-executive directors. Therefore, we should focus on the "Suspicious transactions" indicator.

The "Suspicious transactions" indicator provides data on the number of suspicious transactions in different years, but it does not directly describe the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain in 2021. This indicator may be related to the detection or monitoring of potential corruption or bribery activities, but it does not provide a detailed description of the management system itself.

2024-03-09 14:59:48.539 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to look at the specific indicators related to safety and health. In this case, the indicators that could provide insights into the discussion of safety risks are the Lost-time injury frequency rate and the Number of lost-time injuries.

Looking at the table, we can see that the Lost-time injury frequency rate for the year 2021 is 0.03, which indicates the rate of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked. This data point directly relates to the management of accident and safety risks in the year 2021. A low frequency rate suggests effective safety management practices, while a high rate may indicate areas of concern.

Similarly, the Number of lost-time injuries for the year 2021 is 17, which represents the actual count of injuries on duty leading to at least one lost day. This data point also provides insights into the safety performance and management of risks in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 can be found by analyzing the Lost-time injury frequency rate and the Number of lost-time injuries.

Conclusion: Yes

2024-03-09 14:59:51.888 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to look at the indicators related to safety and health. In this case, we should focus on the "Number of lost-time injuries" and "Number of first aid cases" columns for the year 2021.

From the table:
- The number of lost-time injuries in 2021 was 14.
- The number of first aid cases in 2021 was not provided.

Based on the information in the table, we can see that the number of lost-time injuries in 2021 is mentioned, but there is no specific information about the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021. The table only provides data on the number of injuries and first aid cases but does not elaborate on the discussion or management strategies related to these risks.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Specifically, we should focus on the columns related to the year 2021.

In the table, the columns for each year show different data points or trends for various indicators. Since we are interested in the discussion of the process in 2021, we should look at the data provided under the column labeled "2021."

If there is any information related to the process of identifying and managing emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021, it would likely be found in the corresponding rows under the "2021" column. This information could be in the form of specific values, trends, comments, or targets related to that process for the year 2021.

Therefore, by examining the data under the "2021" column in the table, we can determine if there is any discussion of the process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in that year.

The question is asking about the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021. In the table, we can see indicators related to packaging such as "of which: paper recycled (tonnes)" and "of which: biodegradable packaging".
