Are you sure that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:24:09.726 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 4.4 in the row for that indicator, but it is not specified whether this value corresponds to 2021 or another year.

In the second table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is not provided. The value for 2021 is not mentioned in the row for that indicator.

In the third table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 4.4.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021?" is 'Yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

So, based on the information provided in the first two tables, the correct answer is 'yes'.

In the second table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 26133. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) in the year 2021?" is again 26133.0.

Are you sure that '5.02' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Intensity ratio in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:24:41.280 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '5.02' in the table, but it is not specified as the Intensity ratio for that year.

In the second table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '5.02'. 

In the third table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '0.03' in the table, but it is not specified as the Intensity ratio for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Intensity ratio in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:25:06.210 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '38.1' in the table, which corresponds to the year 2020. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot confirm that '38.1' is the correct answer for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is not given in the table. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot confirm the correct value for the year 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '38.1'. Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table, '38.1' is indeed the correct answer for the year 2021.

The Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The value for 2021 is given as 6.5 for this indicator in the second table. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table alone, we cannot confirm that the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in 2021 was 6.5.

For the second table:
The Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 6.5. Therefore, in this case, we can confirm that the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in 2021 was 6.5 based on the information provided in the second table.

For the third table:
The Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The value for 2021 is given as 6.5 for this indicator in the second table. Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table alone, we cannot confirm that the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in 2021 was 6.5.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:25:46.083 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for total tax payments in the year 2021. The table only mentions "Taxes paid" and "Per tax type (%)" without specifying any numerical values for the years. Therefore, we cannot determine the total tax payments in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the total indirect taxes paid in the year 2021 is given as 2.9 Rbn. This value does not represent the total tax payments for that year, as it specifically refers to indirect taxes only. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the total tax payments in 2021 were 8.4 Rbn based on this table.

In the third table, the corporate taxes paid in the year 2021 are given as 5.5 Rbn. Again, this value does not represent the total tax payments for that year, as it specifically refers to corporate taxes only. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the total tax payments in 2021 were 8.4 Rbn based on this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the total tax payments in the year 2021 to be 8.4 Rbn.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '199.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Learnerships – to unemployed / Learnerships – to individuals with disabilities / Internships in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:26:26.259 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

|                                                 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities |    253 |    199 |     30 | n/a    |
| Internships                                     |    742 |    651 |    300 | n/a    |

For the year 2021, the number of Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities is 199, and the number of Internships is 651. Therefore, the Learnerships - to unemployed value for 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

Moving on to the second table:

|                                                 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Learnerships - to unemployed                    |   1278 |    984 |    200 | n/a    |
| Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities |    253 |    199 |     30 | n/a    |

In this table, the Learnerships - to unemployed value for 2021 is explicitly given as 984. Therefore, the value of 199.0 is not the correct answer for the Learnerships - to unemployed in 2021.

Lastly, looking at the third table:

|                                     | 2022   | 2021   |   2020 | 2019   |
|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Internships                         | 742    | 651    |    300 | n/a    |
| Face-to-face (hours of instruction) | –      | –      | 102445 | 703803 |

The table does not provide the Learnerships - to unemployed or Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities values for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Learnerships – to unemployed / Learnerships – to individuals with disabilities / Internships in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '709.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total waste (tonnes) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:26:40.560 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 709 in the table, but it is not clear if this is the correct value for that year.

In the second table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 709.

In the third table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 378.5 for Paper waste, but this does not represent the total waste for that year.

Therefore, the correct Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is 709 as stated in the second table.

Are you sure that '55.33' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average training hours per person, by gender and by race, including compliance training - Female in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:26:52.393 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the average hours training per person in 2021 is 55.33. However, this table does not provide information on the breakdown by gender or race.

Moving on to the second table, the average hours training per person in 2021 is also 55.33. Again, this table does not specify the breakdown by gender or race.

Finally, in the third table, there is no information provided about the average training hours per person by gender and race for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average training hours per person, by gender and by race, including compliance training - Female in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, the Independent non-executive directors are not mentioned, so we cannot determine the value for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Independent non-executive directors for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 12. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '12', not '12.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:27:03.770 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Non-executive directors for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, '1.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question for this table.

Looking at the second table, the Non-executive directors for the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, '1.0' is again the correct answer to the question for this table.

Looking at the third table, the Non-executive directors for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, '1.0' is once more the correct answer to the question for this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '1.0' is the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" in all three cases.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:27:11.998 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first markdown table, the value for the Physical footprint - Branches in the year 2021 is 989, not 989.0. The table does not provide the value with decimal points, so '989' is the correct answer.

In the second markdown table, there is no information provided about the year 2021, so we cannot determine the value for the Physical footprint - Branches in that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Physical footprint - Branches in the year 2021?" is '989' from the first table.

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO_{2} ) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:27:14.431 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 187237. Therefore, '187237.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?".

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:27:21.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 shows the value of "187237" for the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2). This value does not correspond to the Air emissions of CO specifically. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of CO specifically for the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:27:46.150 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no explicit mention of the amount of assets under management for the year 2021. The table mainly focuses on environmental and social data related to financial services and operations. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, we see data for two asset management firms - Black Rock Incorporated and GIC Asset Management. The values provided in the table are 4.4 for Black Rock Incorporated in 2022 and 3.75 for Black Rock Incorporated in 2021. However, the question specifically asks for the amount of assets under management for the year 2021. The value of 3.75 corresponds to the year 2021 for Black Rock Incorporated. Therefore, '3.75' is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management for the year 2021.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '98.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:04.090 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021. The only attendance rate provided in this table is for the Board meeting, which is 98% for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of the Audit committee meeting attendance rate at all. The only attendance rate provided in this table is for the Board meeting, which is also 98% for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

In the third table, there is no mention of the Audit committee meeting attendance rate either. The only relevant information provided is the total number of board and board committee meetings for the year 2021, which is 105. Therefore, based on the information in the third table, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '55.33' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the The average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:20.880 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for the year 2021 shows that the employees completing Preventing Financial Crime training (%) was 98.2, not the average hours of training per person. Therefore, the value of 55.33 is not the correct answer for the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 in the first table.

Looking at the second table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 for the Employees completing the Absa Way Code of Ethics training (%), so we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the row for the year 2021 shows that the average hours training per person was 55.33. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021?" is indeed 55.33 in the third table.

Are you sure that '40.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:34.822 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for that year from this table.

In the second table, there is also no specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for that year from this table as well.

In the third table, there is no mention of black board members or any specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for any year. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '40.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021?".

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:43.254 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of '4.4' is for the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises, not specifically for the cost relating to acquisition.

In the second table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value of '8.5' is for the Total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies.

In the third table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '4.4'. Therefore, in this case, '4.4' is the correct answer to the question.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.

Are you sure that '51.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:47.242 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table for Zambia in the year 2021, the column "Tangible assets other than cash Rm" shows a value of 51, which is not explicitly labeled as Depreciation. However, Tangible assets other than cash can include assets that are subject to depreciation. Therefore, it is possible that the value of 51.0 could represent Depreciation as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '84.52' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:28:56.129 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '84.52' corresponds to the "Vote for Remuneration Policy (%)" for the year 2021, not the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures.

In the second table, the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided either. The value '84.52' corresponds to the "Vote for Remuneration Policy (%)" for the year 2021 in this table as well.

In the third table, the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures for the year 2021 is not mentioned. The value '86.7' corresponds to the "Vote for proposed remuneration for non-executive directors (%)" for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '84.52' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '14.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:07.137 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Work-related injuries in 2021: 25
   - There is no specific mention of the discussion of management of accident and safety risks in 2021.
   - The value '14.0' is not provided in this table for the year 2021.
   
2. **Table 2:**
   - Number of lost-time injuries in 2021: 14
   - Number of first aid cases in 2021: Not provided
   - There is no specific mention of the discussion of management of accident and safety risks in 2021.
   - The value '14.0' is not explicitly stated in this table for the year 2021.
   
3. **Table 3:**
   - Days lost due to injuries in 2021: 185
   - Fatalities in 2021: Not provided
   - There is no specific mention of the discussion of management of accident and safety risks in 2021.
   - The value '14.0' is not provided in this table for the year 2021.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, the value '14.0' is not mentioned as the discussion of management of accident and safety risks in the year 2021 in any of the tables.

**Conclusion: No**

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:17.571 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first markdown table:

| Indicator                         |   Trend |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   | Notes   |
|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| of which: biodegradable packaging |       1 |     12 |     81 |      4 |    191 | –      |         |
| Waste to landfill (tonnes)        |       1 |    193 |    250 |    777 |   1415 | 6112   |         |

In the row for the year 2021, the value for "of which: biodegradable packaging" is 81. This indicates that in 2021, there were 81 units of biodegradable packaging. However, this information does not directly relate to the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products. Therefore, based on this table alone, we cannot confirm that '81.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: No

Now, let's analyze the second markdown table:

| Indicator                         |   Trend |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   | Notes   |

| of which: biodegradable packaging |       1 |     12 |     81 |      4 |    191 | –      |         |

In this table, the row for the year 2021 shows that the value for "of which: biodegradable packaging" is indeed 81. This indicates that in 2021, there were 81 units of biodegradable packaging. However, as mentioned earlier, this information does not directly relate to the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products. Therefore, based on this table alone, we still cannot confirm that '81.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: No

In both cases, the value of '81.0' for biodegradable packaging in 2021 does not provide the information needed to answer the question about the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products.

Therefore, '81.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

Moving on to the second table, the value of '81' is also present in the row corresponding to the year 2021 for the indicator "of which: biodegradable packaging". Therefore, '81.0' is the correct answer for this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no value provided for the year 2021 in the row corresponding to the indicator "Recycling rate". Therefore, we cannot determine the value for the year 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '616.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of process to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:25.801 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row "Disciplinary cases ongoing" for the year 2021 has a value of 616, not 616.0. So, the value of 616.0 is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table.

For the second table:
- The row "Absa Regional Operations" does not have any values filled in for any year, including 2021. So, the value of 616.0 is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table.

For the third table:
- The row "South Africa1" does not have any values filled in for any year, including 2021. So, the value of 616.0 is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information in the tables provided, the value of 616.0 is not the correct answer to the question regarding the year 2021. 

**Conclusion: No**

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:29.036 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for "of which: biodegradable packaging" is 81. This indicates the amount of biodegradable packaging in that year. However, there is no explicit mention of a discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot confirm that "81.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021.
