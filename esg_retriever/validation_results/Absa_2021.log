The table includes an indicator for "Average age," but it does not provide a breakdown of the average age for individuals specifically aged 50 and above.

Since there is no specific information on the average age of individuals aged 50 and above in the table, we cannot directly determine the average age of individuals in that age group for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average age 50+ in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 17:45:32.560 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost-time injury frequency rate for South Africa in the year 2021, we need to look at the specific indicator in the provided markdown table. The table includes the Lost-time injury frequency rate for Absa Regional Operations, but this specific rate is not directly applicable to South Africa as a whole.

The table does not provide a separate entry for the Lost-time injury frequency rate for South Africa in 2021. The only related information is the Lost-time injury frequency rate for Absa Regional Operations, which is not the same as the rate for South Africa.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked) (South Africa) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The "Total waste (tonnes)" indicator provides the total amount of waste generated, but it does not specify how much of this waste was sent to landfill. Similarly, the "Recycled waste (tonnes)" indicator only tells us the amount of waste that was recycled, not the amount that went to landfill.

Since there is no specific indicator for Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the amount of waste sent to landfill in the year 2021 from the context provided.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:46:57.225 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the Local procurement as a percentage of total (South Africa) (%) in the year 2021, we would need additional information beyond what is provided in the table. The table only includes data on the total procurement spend in South Africa for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. 

To calculate the Local procurement as a percentage of total, we would need the breakdown of how much of the total procurement spend is considered local procurement. This breakdown is not explicitly provided in the table. Without the specific values for local procurement spend and total procurement spend, we cannot calculate the percentage for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Local procurement as a percentage of total (South Africa) (%) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

In the provided markdown table, the value for the "Number of programs accessed" in 2021 is 7294.

However, the indicator provided in the table is the number of programs accessed, not the total hours for programs accessed. The total hours for programs accessed would require additional information, such as the average duration of each program or the total hours spent on all programs accessed in 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

The table includes indicators such as "Renewable - Wind (PPA)" and "Non-renewable - Gas (kWh)."

The indicator "Non-renewable - Gas (kWh)" provides data on non-renewable electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) for gas. However, this indicator specifically mentions gas and not electricity in general. It does not provide information on other sources of non-renewable electricity, such as coal or oil.

Since the table only includes data for non-renewable electricity consumption related to gas, and not a comprehensive category covering all non-renewable electricity sources, we cannot determine the total non-renewable electricity consumption for the year 2021 from this table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:49:19.258 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of Learnerships to unemployed, Learnerships to individuals with disabilities, and Internships specifically for the year 2021, we need to look at the data for that specific year in the provided markdown table.

From the table, we can see that the number of Learnerships to unemployed in 2021 was 984, and the number of Learnerships to individuals with disabilities in 2021 was 199. However, there is no specific mention of the number of Internships for the year 2021 in the table.

Since the table only provides data for Learnerships to unemployed and Learnerships to individuals with disabilities for the year 2021, and does not include information on Internships for that year, we cannot directly determine the number of Internships in 2021 from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Learnerships – to unemployed / Learnerships – to individuals with disabilities / Internships in the year 2021?" is partially retrievable from the context, as we have information on Learnerships but not on Internships.

The table includes indicators such as "Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn)" but does not explicitly mention the Total procurement spend in South Africa for the year 2021.

The indicator "Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn)" specifically refers to the spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers, which is a subset of the total procurement spend. It does not represent the overall Total procurement spend in South Africa for the year 2021.

Additionally, the table does not contain a specific indicator related to the overall Total procurement spend in South Africa for the year 2021. Without a direct indicator for the total procurement spend, we cannot retrieve the specific value for the Total procurement spend in South Africa for the year 2021 from the provided context.

- Terminations (permanent employees) in 2021: 3072
- Resignations in 2021: 1795

To find the total employee turnover in 2021, we need to sum the terminations and resignations:
Employee turnover in 2021 = Terminations + Resignations
Employee turnover in 2021 = 3072 + 1795

The indicator "Women board members" only specifies the number of women on the board, not the total number of board members. Without a separate indicator for the total number of board members or information on the gender composition of the entire board, we cannot determine the exact number of board members in the year 2021 from the given table.

Since the table does not provide the total number of people or individuals who received training in each year, we cannot calculate the average hours of training per person for the year 2021 based on the information given. The table lacks the necessary data to determine the average hours of training per person specifically for 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average hours training per person in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators for "Non-executive directors" and "Executive directors," but it does not explicitly mention "Independent non-executive directors."

Since the table does not differentiate between non-executive directors who are independent and those who are not, we cannot directly retrieve the number of Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021 from the context provided.

The table includes indicators for "Executive directors" and "Independent Board Chairman," but it does not explicitly mention the number of Independent non-executive directors.

The presence of an Independent Board Chairman does not necessarily indicate the number of Independent non-executive directors on the board. The roles of Independent Board Chairman and Independent non-executive directors are distinct, and the information provided in the table does not directly specify the number of Independent non-executive directors.

Without a specific indicator for Independent non-executive directors or a breakdown of the board composition, we cannot determine the exact number of Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Independent non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 17:51:41.416 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to carbon emissions in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Carbon emission per m2 of office space" and "Water consumption (kilolitres)."

The table does not have a direct indicator for total carbon emissions in tonnes for each year. The indicator "Carbon emission per m2 of office space" provides information on carbon emissions per square meter of office space, but it does not give the total carbon emissions in tonnes for the year 2021.

Since there is no specific indicator for total carbon emissions in tonnes for the year 2021 in the table, the answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Since there is no specific indicator related to CO emissions in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the information on the air emissions of CO for the year 2021 from the context.

2024-03-10 17:52:25.608 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to PM10 emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on carbon emissions, specifically total carbon emissions in tonnes of CO2 for different years.

Since the table does not provide any data or information related to particulate matter (PM10) emissions, we cannot directly find the air emissions of PM10 for the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (4) particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The All Injury Frequency Rate typically considers all injuries, not just lost-time injuries, and is calculated per 1 million hours worked.

Since the table only provides data for the lost-time injury frequency rate per 200,000 person hours worked, and not the All Injury Frequency Rate per 1 million hours worked, the specific question regarding the All Injury Frequency Rate in the year 2021 cannot be directly answered from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "Lost-time injury frequency rate" and "Number of lost-time injuries."

The "Lost-time injury frequency rate" indicator provides the number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked, which is not directly the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked). The All Injury Frequency Rate typically calculates the number of injuries per 1 million hours worked, whereas the provided indicator is based on a different denominator (200,000 person hours worked).

Since the specific All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table, the answer to the question "What was the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators for the Lost-time injury frequency rate, which is not the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate.

The Lost-time injury frequency rate is specifically defined as the number of lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked. This is different from the All Injury Frequency Rate, which typically considers all injuries, not just lost-time injuries, per 1 million hours worked.

Since the table does not provide a direct indicator for the All Injury Frequency Rate in the year 2021, and the available indicator is specific to lost-time injuries per 200,000 person hours worked, we cannot directly retrieve the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021 from the context.

The table includes an indicator "Regulatory fines (Rm)" which provides the amount of regulatory fines in million units (Rm) for each year, including 2021.

The value under the "Regulatory fines (Rm)" for the year 2021 is 2.1. This value represents the amount of regulatory fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:53:55.400 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to fines in the provided markdown table. The table includes an indicator called "Regulatory fines (Rm)" which provides the amount of regulatory fines in million units (Rm) for each year, including 2021.

While the "Regulatory fines (Rm)" indicator gives us information about regulatory fines, it does not explicitly state whether these fines include fines paid or payable due to settlements. Settlement fines may not always fall under regulatory fines, as they can be a separate category of fines.

Without a specific breakdown of the fines to differentiate between regulatory fines and fines paid or payable due to settlements, we cannot determine the exact amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 from the context provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 17:54:45.504 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators such as "Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper purchased (tonnes)" and "Green buildings."

There is no indicator in the table that directly provides information on the area of forestland with protected conservation status. The indicators listed in the table are related to paper purchasing and green buildings, not specifically to forestland conservation status.

Without a specific indicator related to the area of forestland with protected conservation status, we cannot determine the exact area of forestland under conservation in 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:55:38.768 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this type of training in the provided markdown table. The table includes an indicator related to ethics, specifically "Employees completing the Absa Way Code of Ethics training (%)."

While this indicator provides information on the percentage of employees completing the Code of Ethics training, it does not directly give the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021. The completion percentage does not translate directly to the number of hours spent on training.

Without a specific indicator that directly states the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021, we cannot determine this information from the context provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes information such as the number of employees, revenue, profit before tax, total tax, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, irrevocable VAT, and other taxes. There is no specific mention of the Cost of sales in the table.

The Cost of sales is a specific line item in the income statement that represents the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by a company. Since there is no direct mention of the Cost of sales in the table, we cannot determine the exact figure for the Cost of sales in the year 2021 from the information provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Without a specific line item for depreciation in the income statement or a related indicator in the table, we cannot determine the depreciation amount as per the income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes information such as the number of employees, revenue, profit before tax, total tax, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, and other tax-related figures.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense that represents the reduction in value of an asset over time. It is typically found in the income statement under operating expenses or as a separate line item. Since the table does not contain any information related to depreciation specifically, we cannot directly retrieve the Depreciation amount as per the income statement in the year 2021 from this table.

The table includes indicators such as "Point of sale (POS) devices" and "Digital," but none of these indicators directly describe the approach to informing customers about products and services.

The indicators in the table seem to focus on the number or type of devices used (POS devices) and the digital aspect, but they do not provide a detailed description of the approach taken to inform customers about products and services in 2021.

Without a specific indicator or information related to the description of the approach to informing customers about products and services in 2021, we cannot directly retrieve the answer from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Description of approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 17:58:06.893 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine if the discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021 can be directly found in the provided markdown table, we need to analyze the information presented.

The table includes an indicator related to ethics, specifically "Employees completing the Absa Way Code of Ethics training (%)." While this indicator provides information on the percentage of employees completing ethics training, it does not directly address the discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict.

The completion of the Code of Ethics training may be related to ethical practices within the organization, but it does not explicitly cover the specific topics of engagement processes, due diligence practices, human rights, indigenous rights, or operations in conflict areas.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:58:51.260 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this topic in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "of which: biodegradable packaging" and "Waste to landfill (tonnes)."

The indicator "of which: biodegradable packaging" shows the quantity of biodegradable packaging, but it does not directly provide information about the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging. It only gives a numerical value related to a specific type of packaging material.

Similarly, the indicator "Waste to landfill (tonnes)" provides data on the amount of waste sent to landfills, which is related to the environmental impact of packaging but does not specifically address the discussion of strategies to reduce this impact.

Since there is no indicator in the table that directly mentions the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 17:58:58.299 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine if the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021 can be directly found in the provided markdown table, we need to carefully analyze the indicators and notes provided.

The table includes an indicator related to Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper purchased in tonnes for the years 2018 to 2022. While this indicator gives insight into the company's paper purchasing practices, it specifically focuses on the certification of the paper and not on the broader discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging.

The notes mention a target of a 50% reduction in paper usage by 2030, which indicates a goal related to paper consumption but does not explicitly discuss strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in general.

Given that the table does not directly provide information on the discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021, the answer to the specific question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.
