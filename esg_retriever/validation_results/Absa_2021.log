Are you sure that '98.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board meeting attendance (%) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:17.872 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Board meeting attendance (%) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2022, 2020, and 2019 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021.

In the second table, the Board meeting attendance (%) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 98. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board meeting attendance (%) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '98'.

In the third table, the Board meeting attendance (%) is not a listed indicator, so there is no information provided for this specific metric for any year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the correct answer to the question is '98.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:22.880 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Average age for the year 2021 is given as 60. Therefore, the Average age 50+ in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

In the second table, the Average age for the year 2021 is given as 60. Therefore, the Average age 50+ in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table either.

In the third table, the value for the Average age 50+ in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The only age-related data given is for "<20 male" and not for the 50+ age group.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Average age 50+ in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:26.255 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '26133' in the table, but it is not clear if this corresponds to the year 2021 or not.

In the second table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '26133', so this confirms that the value is indeed for the year 2021.

In the third table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not provided.

Therefore, based on the information given in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) in the year 2021?" is '26133' as explicitly stated in the second table.

Are you sure that '0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal-injury frequency rate (number of fatalities per 200 000 person hours worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:28.169 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the Fatal-injury frequency rate, the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows "nil" for all years including 2021. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it is not possible to determine the Fatal-injury frequency rate for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '5.02' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Intensity ratio in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:35.710 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Since the value for 2021 is not mentioned, we cannot confirm that '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

In the second table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '5.02'. Therefore, in this case, '5.02' is indeed the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

In the third table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not provided. The values given are for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Since the value for 2021 is missing, we cannot confirm that '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

Conclusion: 
For the first and third tables, we cannot confirm the Intensity ratio for 2021. However, in the second table, '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.06' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked) (South Africa) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:39.449 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Lost-time injury frequency rate (number of lost-time injuries per 200 000 person hours worked) for South Africa in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 0.06 in the table, but this corresponds to a different year. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct value for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Lost-time injury frequency rate for South Africa in 2021 is explicitly stated as 0.06. This value matches the question asked.

In the third table, the Lost-time injury frequency rate for South Africa in 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 0.03 in the table, which corresponds to a different indicator. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct value for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Yes, the correct Lost-time injury frequency rate for South Africa in 2021 is 0.06 based on the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:51:57.823 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.

Looking at the second table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '5.8' is for the year 2021, but it corresponds to the Annual salary increase - unionised staff (%), not the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '38.1' is the correct answer for the year 2021 based on this table.

Looking at the third table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '15' is for the Number of trade unions in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '38.1' is the correct answer for the year 2021 based on this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '6.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:52:09.363 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact spend for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) for the year 2021 is given as 6.5. 

In the third table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact spend for 2021 from this table.

So, based on the second table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is 6.5.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:52:20.850 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Water consumption (kilolitres) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The last available data point is for the year 2020.

In the second table, the Total energy use (kWh) is provided for the year 2021 but not the Water consumption.

In the third table, the Water consumption (kilolitres) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 206103.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Water consumption (kilolitres) in the year 2021 is indeed 206103. 

Yes.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:52:43.022 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

|                                                 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities |    253 |    199 |     30 | n/a    |

For the year 2021, the number of Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities is 199, and the number of Internships is 651. Therefore, the Learnerships - to unemployed value for 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

Moving on to the second table:

|                                                 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |

| Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities |    253 |    199 |     30 | n/a    |

In this table, the number of Learnerships - to unemployed for 2021 is explicitly given as 984. Therefore, the value of 199.0 for Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities in 2021 is incorrect.

Lastly, looking at the third table:

This table does not provide information about Learnerships or Learnerships - to unemployed, so it does not impact the comparison.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct number for Learnerships - to individuals with disabilities in 2021 is 199, not 199.0. 

Conclusion: No

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:14.200 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for Non-executive directors in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '1'.

Looking at the second table, the value for Non-executive directors in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '1'.

Looking at the third table, there is no explicit value provided for Non-executive directors in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for Non-executive directors in 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '1' for the first two tables. For the third table, the answer is not explicitly stated.

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:33.159 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row related to "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2)" shows a value of 187237 for that year. However, this value represents total carbon emissions and not specifically emissions of CO. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of CO specifically for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:37.626 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2)" provides the values for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018. The value for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions specifically in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:41.278 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the second table for the year 2021. The relevant row is for the "Total" entry.

Looking at the "Total" row for the year 2021:
- Revenue less other income Rm: 85171
- Profit before tax Rm: 26722
- Total tax expenditure Rm: 7407
- Total tax payments Rm: 8463
- Corporate taxes Rm: 5548
- Payroll taxes Rm: 171
- Irrevocable VAT2 Rm: 1575
- WHT and other taxes Rm: 1169

The ALL Administration expenses are not explicitly provided in this table. Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.06' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:46.094 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table (South Africa), the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019, but the specific value for 2021 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021 from this table.

For the second table (Absa Regional Operations), the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 0.03. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021?" for this table is 0.03.

For the third table (Absa Regional Operations), the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021 is also explicitly given as 0.03. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021?" for this table is 0.03.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the tables:
- For the first table (South Africa), we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021.
- For the second table (Absa Regional Operations), the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021 is 0.03.
- For the third table (Absa Regional Operations), the All Injury Frequency Rate for 2021 is 0.03.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:51.338 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The value '249.5' corresponds to the amount of general waste (landfill) in tonnes for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, the answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is **no**.

Now, moving on to the second table, the information related to assets under management by asset class is not present. The table focuses on green buildings and waste per type in tonnes, but does not mention assets under management by asset class.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is also **no**.

Finally, in the third table, the focus is on environmental and social data related to financial services and operations. There is no mention of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table, the answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is **no**.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in all three tables, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '8.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:53:56.641 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine that the amount was '8.5' in 2021.

In the second table, the total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies is provided for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. The amount for 2021 is given as '8.5'. However, the question is about the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in 2021, which is not explicitly stated in this table. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the answer is '8.5' based on this table.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that '8.5' is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '80.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:54:06.738 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that the Total waste (tonnes) sent for recycling is 709, but there is no specific value provided for Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot determine the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the Recycled waste (tonnes) is 459, but again, there is no specific value provided for Food Waste Recovered. Therefore, we cannot determine the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, we can see that the Recycled waste (tonnes) is 459, and the value of paper recycled is 379. Since the question specifically asks for Food Waste Recovered, and this value is not explicitly provided in the table, we cannot determine the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:54:10.222 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021 is 23.99, not 69.96. Therefore, the value of 69.96 is not the correct answer for the Area of forestland leased in 2021 in the first table.

In the second table, the value for the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021 is 69.96. Therefore, the value of 69.96 is the correct answer for the Area of forestland leased in 2021 in the second table.

In the third table, there is no specific value provided for the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:54:15.613 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the area of forestland owned is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the area of forestland owned in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the area of forestland owned is also not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the area of forestland owned in 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '105.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:54:19.389 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the total number of board and board committee meetings was 105. Therefore, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 cannot be 105.0 as it is the total number of meetings, not the attendance rate.

So, the answer is 'No'.

This table does not provide specific information about health, safety, and emergency response training.

Moving on to the second table, the Average hours training per person for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific number of hours for health, safety, and emergency response training in 2021 from this table.

In the third table, there is no information related to health, safety, and emergency response training. The row "Occupational health and safety" does not provide the average number of hours of training.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:54:29.663 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the average hours of training per person for the year 2021 is 55.33. However, this table does not specify whether this training is specifically for health, safety, and emergency response for contract employees.

Moving on to the second table, the average hours of training per person for the year 2021 is also 55.33. Again, this table does not provide specific information about health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees.

Finally, in the third table, there is no information provided for the average hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively state that the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021 was 55.33.

Are you sure that '55.33' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the The average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:35.390 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for the year 2021 shows that the average hours of training per person in that year was 55.33. However, this table does not specifically mention the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot definitively state that 55.33 is the correct answer to the question regarding the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:39.634 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021: 16.3 Rbn
   - Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises in 2021: Not provided
   - Therefore, we cannot calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 from this table.

2. **Table 2**:
   - Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises in 2021: 4.4 Rbn
   - Therefore, the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 is 4.4 / 16.3 * 100 = 27.05%

3. **Table 3**:
   - Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021: 16.3 Rbn
   - Total procurement spend with locally registered suppliers in 2021: 16 Rbn
   - Therefore, we cannot calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of Table 2, the correct answer to the question is 27.05%, not 27.16%.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:45.807 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

In the table, there is no specific mention of the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to "BA1 to BA4" and "Cost-to-company," which do not directly correspond to the question asked. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, it is not possible to determine the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021.

For the second table:

In the second table, the row "Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn)" provides the values for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. However, the specific percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in the table. The table only provides the Rand values for procurement spend with locally registered suppliers and B-BBEE-accredited suppliers, without specifying the percentage related to EME's.

For the third table:

In the third table, the row "Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn)" provides the values for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. However, the specific percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in the table. The table mentions the total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and provides the Rand values for spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers, but it does not specify the percentage related to EME's.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the three tables, the specific percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if '1.1' is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '48.51' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:48.167 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2019, we can see that the percentage of African board members is 47.79%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021?" is 'no'. The value of 48.51% corresponds to the year 2019, not 2021.

So, the correct answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '5548.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:52.760 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the first markdown table. Specifically, we need to focus on the row corresponding to the year 2021.

In the row for the year 2021:
- Corporate taxes Rm = 5548

Therefore, the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021 is indeed 5548.0.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '85171.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:55:55.418 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the column headers do not explicitly mention "Cost of sales" as a separate line item. However, we can infer that the closest relevant value to "Cost of sales" would be "Revenue less other income Rm" which is 85171 for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the available information in the first table for the year 2021, the closest approximation to the Cost of sales would be 85171.0.

Conclusion: Yes

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Are you sure that '73.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:01.830 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the column headers do not explicitly mention "Depreciation" as a separate line item. The closest values we have are "Tangible assets other than cash Rm" and "Profit before tax Rm," but neither of these directly represents Depreciation.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table for the year 2021, we cannot definitively state that "73.0" is the correct answer for the Depreciation as per the income statement.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '5.41' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:11.495 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually:

1. **Table 1:**
   - The table provides data for M&G (SA, UK) and Public Investment Corporation (SA) for the years 2022 and 2021.
   - The value for the Public Investment Corporation (SA) in 2021 is 5.41.
   - There is no information related to the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in this table.

2. **Table 2:**
   - The table provides indicators with trends and values for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
   - The indicator related to voting for proposed remuneration for non-executive directors has a value of 86.7 for 2021.
   - There is no information related to the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table provides data for Public Investment Corporation (SA) and Black Rock Incorporated (US, UK, JP, CA) for the years 2022 and 2021.
   - The value for the Public Investment Corporation (SA) in 2021 is 5.41.
   - There is no information related to the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, the value of '5.41' does not correspond to the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is **no**.

Are you sure that '0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:22.997 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - No specific value is provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "Percentage of total person days lost due to industrial action (%)."
   - No specific value is provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "Fatal-injury frequency rate (number of fatalities per 200 000 person)."

2. **Table 2:**
   - The value for work-related injuries in the year 2021 is 25.

3. **Table 3:**
   - No specific value is provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "Paper."
   - No specific value is provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "Electronic waste."

Based on the analysis of the tables, the value '0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021. The information provided in the tables does not support the conclusion that the value was '0' for that specific year.
