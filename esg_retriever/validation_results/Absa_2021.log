Are you sure that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:30:20.519 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2022, 2020, and 2019 are given as 2.6, 3.5, and 2.7 respectively, but there is no value specified for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot confirm that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises (Rbn) in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:30:33.516 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Average age 50+ in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Average age in 2021: 60
   - 40 - 49 years category does not provide specific data for 50+
   - Conclusion: The Average age 50+ in 2021 is not explicitly provided in Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - Average age in 2021: 60
   - 10+ years category does not provide specific data for 50+
   - Conclusion: The Average age 50+ in 2021 is not explicitly provided in Table 2.

3. Table 3:
   - By age category: <20 male in 2021: 1
   - Average age for 2021 is not explicitly provided
   - Conclusion: The Average age 50+ in 2021 is not explicitly provided in Table 3.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, the Average age 50+ in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in any of the tables.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average age 50+ in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:30:36.895 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '26133'. Therefore, '26133' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) in the year 2021?".

In the second table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is also explicitly provided as '26133'. Therefore, '26133' is again the correct answer to the question for this table.

In the third table, the Staff costs and benefits (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year from this table.

Are you sure that '0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal-injury frequency rate (number of fatalities per 200 000 person hours worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:30:39.237 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the Fatal-injury frequency rate, the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows "nil" for all years including 2021. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it is not possible to determine the Fatal-injury frequency rate for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '5.02' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Intensity ratio in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:30:45.637 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the Intensity ratio for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 5.02. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is indeed 5.02.

In the third table, the Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not provided. The values given are for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the Intensity ratio for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '249.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

2024-03-07 21:30:56.165 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for Waste to landfill is not explicitly stated. The value provided for the year 2021 in the General waste (landfill) row is 249.5, but this value corresponds to General waste (landfill) and not specifically Waste to landfill. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that '249.5' is the correct answer to the question "What was the Waste to landfill (tonnes) in the year 2021?".

- The value for Fatal-injury frequency rate for the year 2021 is not mentioned as 'nil' or '0'.
- Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the Fatal-injury frequency rate for the year 2021 is '0'.

For the second table:
- Fatalities for the year 2021 is explicitly mentioned as 'nil'.
- Therefore, we can confidently say that the Fatalities for the year 2021 is '0'.

For the third table:
- Fatalities for the year 2021 is explicitly mentioned as 'nil'.
- Therefore, we can confidently say that the Fatalities for the year 2021 is '0'.

Conclusion: 
- For the first table, we cannot determine the Fatalities for the year 2021.
- For the second and third tables, the Fatalities for the year 2021 is '0'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:31:23.743 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020 and 2019 are given as 4.8 and 5.7 respectively, but there is no specific value for 2021.

In the second table, the Total procurement spend on >30% black-owned companies (Rbn) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 6.5.

In the second table, the Total energy use (kWh) is provided for the year 2021, but there is no information about Water consumption for that year.

In the third table, the Water consumption (kilolitres) for the year 2021 is indeed 206103.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Water consumption (kilolitres) in the year 2021 is 206103.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:31:45.540 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020 and 2019 are given as 17.8 and 17.7, respectively. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that the Total weighted spend for 2021 is 16.3 based on the information provided in this table.

In the second table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 16.3. Therefore, in this case, we can confidently say that the Total weighted spend for 2021 is indeed 16.3.

In the third table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2020 and 2019 are given as 17.8 and 17.7, respectively. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that the Total weighted spend for 2021 is 16.3 based on the information provided in this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:31:59.281 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) in the year 2021.

Table 1:
|                                          |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |
|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) |   1056 |   1148 |    864 | 782    |

In Table 1, the Employee bursaries for 2021 is explicitly given as 1148.

Table 2:
|                                          |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |
|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Graduate programme (number of graduates) |    107 |     32 |     35 |     65 |
| Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) |   1056 |   1148 |    864 |    782 |

In Table 2, the Employee bursaries for 2021 is also explicitly given as 1148.

Table 3:
| Indicator                                    |   Trend |   2022 |    2021 |    2020 |   2019 | Targets/Comments   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|--------------------|
| Staff costs and benefits (Rbn)               |       1 |  27873 | 26133   | 25407   |  26262 |                    |
| Annual salary increase - unionised staff (%) |       1 |      8 |     5.8 |     4.1 |      7 |                    |

In Table 3, there is no mention of Employee bursaries for the year 2021.

Conclusion: 
The Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1148 in both Table 1 and Table 2. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '18.9' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend in South Africa (Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:32:09.100 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total procurement spend in South Africa (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 18.9 in the table, but it is not specified whether this value corresponds to the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that '18.9' is the correct answer to the question.

In the second table, the Total procurement spend in South Africa (Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 18.9. So, in this case, '18.9' is the correct answer to the question.

In the third table, the Total procurement spend in South Africa (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 16.3 in the table, which does not correspond to the year in question. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that '18.9' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: 
For the second table, '18.9' is the correct answer to the question. For the first and third tables, we cannot confirm if '18.9' is the correct answer.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:32:38.354 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for Non-executive directors in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '1'. 

Looking at the second table, the value for Non-executive directors in the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 1. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021?" is '1'.

Looking at the third table, there is no explicit value provided for Non-executive directors in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year based on the information given.

Conclusion: 
For the first two tables, the correct answer is '1'. For the third table, the answer is not explicitly provided.

Yes

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

Are you sure that '16391.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:09.770 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the second table for the year 2021. The relevant row is for the "Total" entry.

From the second table for the year 2021:
- Revenue less other income Rm: 85171
- Profit before tax Rm: 26722
- Total tax expenditure Rm: 7407
- Total tax payments Rm: 8463
- Corporate taxes Rm: 5548
- Payroll taxes Rm: 171
- Irrevocable VAT2 Rm: 1575
- WHT and other taxes Rm: 1169

To find the ALL Administration expenses, we need to subtract the sum of Total tax expenditure, Corporate taxes, Payroll taxes, Irrevocable VAT2, and WHT and other taxes from the Profit before tax.

ALL Administration expenses = Profit before tax - (Total tax expenditure + Corporate taxes + Payroll taxes + Irrevocable VAT2 + WHT and other taxes)
ALL Administration expenses = 26722 - (7407 + 5548 + 171 + 1575 + 1169)
ALL Administration expenses = 26722 - 15870
ALL Administration expenses = 10852

Therefore, the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021 is 10852.

Conclusion: No, 16391.0 is not the correct answer.

Are you sure that '249.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:17.572 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The value '249.5' corresponds to the amount of general waste (landfill) in 2021, not the assets under management.

Looking at the second table, the row "Waste per type (tonnes)" does not provide information about assets under management by asset class. Therefore, the value '249.5' is not relevant to this question.

Looking at the third table, the information provided is related to environmental and social data in financial services operations, not assets under management by asset class.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '8.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:22.319 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management by asset class for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the total procurement spend on >51% black-owned companies for the year 2021 is given as 8.5 Rbn. However, this value does not represent the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in 2021. The table does not provide information on the assets under management by asset class for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '80.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:30.558 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that there is no specific value provided for "Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered." Therefore, we cannot determine the exact volume of food waste recovered in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the "Recycled waste (tonnes)" value is provided as 459, but there is no specific breakdown for food waste recovered. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact volume of food waste recovered in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, we can see that the "Recycled waste (tonnes)" value is provided as 459, and there is a breakdown for "of which: paper recycled (tonnes)" as 379. However, there is no specific value provided for food waste recovered. Therefore, we still cannot determine the exact volume of food waste recovered in 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '847.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:40.190 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the area of forestland owned is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the area of forestland owned in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the area of forestland owned is also not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the area of forestland owned in 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the area of forestland owned is not mentioned in any of the rows. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the area of forestland owned in 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:33:45.380 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table:

| Indicator                                          |   Trend |   2022 |   2021 | 2020   | 2019   |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total number of board and board committee meetings |       1 |     97 |    105 | 94     | 86     |

For the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021, we need to look at the row corresponding to the "Total number of board and board committee meetings." In 2021, the total number of meetings was 105.0.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?" is '105.0'.

In the third table, there is no specific mention of the Average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:05.027 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021: 16.3 Rbn
   - Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises in 2021: Not provided
   - Therefore, we cannot calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 from this table.

2. **Table 2**:
   - Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises in 2021: 4.4 Rbn
   - Therefore, the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 is 4.4 / 16.3 * 100 = 27.05%

3. **Table 3**:
   - Total procurement spend with locally registered suppliers in 2021: 16 Rbn
   - Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in 2021: 16.3 Rbn
   - Therefore, we cannot calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, the correct answer to the question is 27.05%, not 27.16%.

Are you sure that '1.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:09.377 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row "Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn)" shows a value of 16.3. This indicates the total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers in the year 2021.

However, the question is specifically asking for the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. This information is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows the total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers, which is not the same as the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine if 1.1 is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '4.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Black female exec. directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:15.743 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021, we need to look at the last table which provides data for the year 2021.

In the last table for the year 2021:
- Total Female African Coloured White directors = 553 (BA4) + 1024 (BA3) = 1577
- Total directors = 3542 (BA4) + 6635 (BA3) = 10177

Therefore, the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021 is (1577 / 10177) * 100 ≈ 15.5%

So, the correct answer to the question "What was the Black female exec. directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021?" is approximately 15.5%.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '171.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:19.618 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table for the year 2021 to determine the Contractor costs per income statement. Looking at the columns provided, we can see that there is no specific value mentioned for Contractor costs in the table for the year 2021. The columns related to costs such as Corporate taxes, Payroll taxes, Irrevocable VAT2, and WHT and other taxes do not directly represent Contractor costs.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot determine the Contractor costs per income statement.

Are you sure that '5548.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

However, without a specific line item for "Cost of sales" in the table, it is not possible to definitively state that 85171.0 represents the Cost of sales as per the income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Cost of sales as per income statement in the year 2021?" is inconclusive. 

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '16391.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:28.926 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the second table provided. Specifically, we need to focus on the row corresponding to the year 2021.

In the second table, the row "Business area 1 to Business area 4" shows the values for each year. For the year 2021, the value is not explicitly provided in the table. The values provided are for the years 2022, 2020, and 2019, but there is no value specified for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '73.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:34:32.228 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value provided in the "Revenue less other income Rm" column is (73), which indicates a negative value. This negative value typically represents a loss rather than depreciation. Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reflects the decrease in value of tangible assets over time.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, it is not correct to state that "73.0" is the Depreciation as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

1. **Table 1:**
   - The table provides data for M&G (SA, UK) and Public Investment Corporation (SA) for the years 2022 and 2021.
   - The value for the Public Investment Corporation (SA) in 2021 is 5.41.
   - There is no information related to the description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in this table.

2. **Table 2:**
   - The table provides indicators with trends and values for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
   - The indicator "Vote for proposed remuneration for non-executive directors (%)" has a value of 86.7 for 2021.
   - There is no information related to the description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table provides data for Public Investment Corporation (SA) and Black Rock Incorporated (US, UK, JP, CA) for the years 2022 and 2021.
   - The value for the Public Investment Corporation (SA) in 2021 is 5.41.
