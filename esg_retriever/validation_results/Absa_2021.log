Are you sure that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:16:47.694 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of '4.4' corresponds to the year 2020 in this table.

In the second table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value of '16.3' corresponds to the year 2021 in this table.

In the third table, the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '4.4'.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021?" based on the third table is '4.4'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

In the third table, the Board meeting attendance (%) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided, so we cannot confirm the value based on this table alone.

Are you sure that '3.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average age 40-49 years in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:16:57.972 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, we can see that the Average age for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 60. However, the value for the age group 40-49 years in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the Average age for the age group 40-49 years in the year 2021 is 3.0 based on the information provided in this table.

Considering each table individually and focusing only on the row corresponding to the year 2021, we do not have the specific value for the Average age of 40-49 years in that year. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is 3.0.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:17:02.842 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Average age for the year 2021 is given as 60, not 61. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average age 50+ in the year 2021?" based on this table is 60, not 61.

Looking at the second table, the Average age for the year 2021 is given as 60, not 61. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average age 50+ in the year 2021?" based on this table is also 60, not 61.

Looking at the third table, the Average age for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the Average age 50+ in the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No, '61.0' is not the correct answer to the question "What was the Average age 50+ in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:17:24.465 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The value for 2021 is given as '5.02' in the row for the Intensity ratio, but it is not specified for that particular year.
- Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot definitively state that '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

For the second table:
- The Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '5.02' in the table.
- Therefore, based on the information given in the table, '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021.

For the third table:
- The Intensity ratio for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for 2021 are given as '0.03' and '0.11' in the rows for the Lost-time injury frequency rate, but it is not specified for the Intensity ratio.
- Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot definitively state the value of the Intensity ratio in 2021.

Conclusion: 
- Yes, '5.02' is the correct answer for the Intensity ratio in 2021 based on the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:17:45.077 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the second table:

|                                     | 2022   | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 |

The question is specifically about the External learning programmes - Leadership and management in the year 2021. Looking at the table, we can see that the value for the Absa Leadership Academy in 2021 is 58258. There is no direct mention of "External learning programmes - Leadership and management" in the table for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the exact value for the External learning programmes - Leadership and management in the year 2021. The value of '90.0' is not explicitly stated in the context.

Are you sure that '38.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:17:47.368 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '38.1' in the table, but this corresponds to the year 2020, not 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, '38.1' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the Percentage of staff covered by an independent union or collective bargaining agreements in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:17:55.548 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Employee diversity (%) - Total women employees for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 60.9, but it is not specified as the Employee diversity (%) for Total women employees. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that '60.9' is the correct answer to the question.

In the second table, the Employee diversity (%) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as 0.2, but it is specified for the category "> 41 years" and not for Total women employees. Therefore, we cannot determine the Employee diversity (%) for Total women employees in 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the Employee diversity (%) - Total women employees for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 60.9. Therefore, in this specific case, '60.9' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: Yes

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:18:04.437 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for total tax payments in the year 2021. The table only includes the indicators "Taxes paid" and "Per tax type (%)", without any specific values for the years mentioned. Therefore, based on this table alone, we cannot determine the total tax payments in 2021.

In the second table, the value provided for "Indirect taxes paid (Rbn)" in the year 2021 is 2.9. However, this value represents only a specific type of tax and not the total tax payments for that year. Therefore, we cannot use this value to determine the total tax payments in 2021.

Looking at the third table, the value provided for "Corporate taxes paid (Rbn)" in the year 2021 is 5.5, not 8.4. This value represents a specific type of tax payment and not the total tax payments for that year. Additionally, the table also provides the value for "Indirect taxes paid (Rbn)" in 2021 as 2.9. Again, this value is specific to a particular type of tax and not the total tax payments for the year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the total tax payments in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '449.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Training spend (Rm) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:18:06.221 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Training spend (Rm) for the year 2021 is given as 449.0.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot confirm that '16.3' is the correct answer to the question.

Looking at the second table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '16.3'. Therefore, in this case, '16.3' is the correct answer to the question.

Looking at the third table, the Total weighted spend with B-BBEE-accredited suppliers (Rbn) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot confirm that '16.3' is the correct answer to the question.

Conclusion: Yes

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 16.3 Rbn in rand?

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '709.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total waste (tonnes) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:18:50.533 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '709.0' is the correct answer.

In the second table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 709. Therefore, '709.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total waste (tonnes) in the year 2021? ".

In the third table, the Total waste (tonnes) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '709.0' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '55.33' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average hours training per person in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:18:59.641 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Average hours training per person for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 55.33. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average hours training per person in the year 2021?" is '55.33'.

In the second table, the Average hours training per person for the year 2021 is also explicitly given as 55.33. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average hours training per person in the year 2021?" is '55.33'.

Looking at the second table, the Average tenure for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 4. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average tenure in the year 2021?" is '4'.

Looking at the third table, the Average tenure for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. It is only provided for the years 2020 and 2019. Therefore, we cannot determine the Average tenure for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average tenure in the year 2021?" is '4' for the first two tables, but it cannot be determined from the third table.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:19:29.968 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 187237. 

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?" based on the first table is 'yes'.

Now, let's move on to the second table. The Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 187237.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?" based on the second table is 'yes'.

Finally, looking at the third table, there is no explicit value provided for the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021. 

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) in the year 2021?" based on the third table is 'no'.

Are you sure that '7407.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:19:45.269 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: To find the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Total" row in each table. 

In the first table for Kenya and Mauritius, the "Total" row does not provide a specific value for ALL Administration expenses. 

In the second table for Ghana and Kenya, the "Total" row also does not provide a specific value for ALL Administration expenses. 

In the third table for Other and Total, the "Total" row does provide a value for Total tax expenditure, which is not the same as ALL Administration expenses.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '3.75' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:19:57.789 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no explicit mention of the amount of assets under management in the year 2021. The table mainly focuses on environmental and social aspects related to financial services and operations. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, it provides data on the performance of two asset management companies in terms of a numerical value for the years 2022 and 2021. The values provided are 4.4 for Black Rock Incorporated and 3.75 for the year 2021. However, these values represent the performance metrics of the asset management companies and not the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the value of '3.75' does not correspond to the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

The table mainly focuses on environmental and social aspects related to financial services and operations. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, we see two financial institutions listed along with their respective asset management values for the years 2022 and 2021. The value of 3.75 is associated with Black Rock Incorporated for the year 2021. However, this value represents the overall asset management value and does not specifically mention the amount of assets under management that employ sustainability themed investing.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot conclusively determine the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:20:11.836 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - The table provides the amount of regulatory fines for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
   - The amount of fines for 2021 is explicitly stated as 2.1.
   - Therefore, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in 2021 is indeed 2.1.

2. **Table 2:**
   - The table provides the amount of regulatory fines for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
   - There is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in this table.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in 2021 from this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table provides the amount of disciplinary cases concluded and the number of cases due to ethical breaches for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
   - There is no information related to fines in this table.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, the correct amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is 2.1 according to Table 1.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '98.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:20:23.966 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2021 are given for "Board meeting attendance (%)", not specifically for the Audit committee. Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The values for 2021 are given for "Board meeting attendance (%)", not specifically for the Audit committee. Therefore, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for 2021 from this table as well.

Looking at the third table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is once again not explicitly provided. The values for 2021 are given for "Total number of board and board committee meetings" and "Board training hours", not specifically for the Audit committee meeting attendance rate.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:20:27.524 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 is 55.33. This value is explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table.

Looking at the second table, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 is also 55.33. This value is explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table.

Looking at the third table, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for 2021 in this table are for "Video training" and "Video training (interventions)", not for the average hours of training per person.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 is indeed 55.33.

Are you sure that '55.33' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:20:31.467 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the average hours of training per person in 2021 is 55.33. However, this table does not specify whether this training includes health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees.

In the second table, the average hours of training per person in 2021 is not explicitly provided.

In the third table, there is no information about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021.

2024-03-06 23:20:53.849 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for that year from this table.

In the second table, there is also no specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for that year from this table.

In the third table, there is no mention of black board members or any specific row indicating the percentage of black board members for any year. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of black board members for the year 2021 from this table as well.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '40.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021?".

2024-03-06 23:21:00.484 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table, there is no specific information provided about Corporate office costs per income statement for the year 2021. The table only includes data on Corporate tax percentages for different years. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the Corporate office costs per income statement for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second markdown table, the row for the year 2021 includes data for various financial metrics related to different types of taxes paid by companies in Kenya and Mauritius. However, there is no specific mention of Corporate office costs per income statement in this table either.

Lastly, in the third markdown table, there is no direct information about Corporate office costs per income statement for the year 2021. The table provides data on Corporate taxes paid and Indirect taxes paid for different years but does not include information on Corporate office costs.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three markdown tables, it is not possible to determine the Corporate office costs per income statement for the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:04.731 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019, but there is no specific value for 2021.

In the second table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is given as 4.4 Rbn.

In the third table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for 2022, 2020, and 2019, but there is no specific value for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '73.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:08.445 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for Zambia in the year 2021, the value provided under "Revenue less other income Rm" is (73), which indicates a negative value. This negative value could potentially represent Depreciation as per the income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table for Zambia in 2021, it is possible that '73.0' could be the Depreciation as per the income statement for that year.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '84.52' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:15.162 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the value '84.52' corresponds to the "Vote for Remuneration Policy (%)" in the year 2021. There is no specific information provided about the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in any of the years in this table.

In the second table, the value '93.96' corresponds to the "Vote for Remuneration Implementation Report (%)" in the year 2021. Again, there is no information provided about the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" in any of the years in this table.

In the third table, there is no relevant information related to the "Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures" for any of the years mentioned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures in the year 2021. 

No.

Are you sure that '14.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:24.878 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Work-related injuries in 2021: 25
   - There is no specific mention of the "Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks" in this table for the year 2021.
   
2. **Table 2:**
   - Number of lost-time injuries in 2021: 14
   - Number of first aid cases in 2021: Not provided
   - There is no specific mention of the "Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks" in this table for the year 2021.
   
3. **Table 3:**
   - Days lost due to injuries in 2021: 185
   - Fatalities in 2021: Not provided
   - There is no specific mention of the "Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks" in this table for the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, none of them explicitly state the "Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks" for the year 2021. Therefore, the value '14.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

**Conclusion: No**

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:32.465 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first markdown table:

| Indicator                         |   Trend |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   | Notes   |

For the question "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021?", we need to focus on the row corresponding to the year 2021. In this table, the row related to biodegradable packaging in 2021 shows a value of 81. Therefore, the value of 81 could potentially be interpreted as the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in 2021.

Conclusion: Yes

Now, let's analyze the second markdown table:

| Indicator                         |   Trend |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   | Notes   |

In this table, the row related to biodegradable packaging in 2021 also shows a value of 81. Therefore, the value of 81 could potentially be interpreted as the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in 2021.

Conclusion: Yes

Considering both tables individually, the value of 81 in the row related to biodegradable packaging in 2021 could be seen as the answer to the question.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:36.509 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value '81' is indeed provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "of which: biodegradable packaging". Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021?" based on this table is '81'.

Moving on to the second table, the value '81' is also provided for the year 2021 under the indicator "of which: biodegradable packaging". Therefore, the answer remains '81' for this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 under any indicator. Therefore, we cannot determine the value for the question based on this table.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the first two tables, the correct answer to the question is '81'.

year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:38.924 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for the "Managing Principal to Principal" indicator is "1.0 - 1.1". There is no mention of "616.0" in this table or row for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, "616.0" is not the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of process to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:42.059 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for "of which: biodegradable packaging" is 81. This indicates the amount of biodegradable packaging in that year. However, the question is about the "Discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging in the year 2021," which is not explicitly mentioned in the table. The table only provides data on the amount of biodegradable packaging but does not mention any discussion of strategies.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot conclude that "81.0" is the correct answer to the question about the discussion of strategies in 2021.
