Are you sure that '4.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total procurement spend on qualifying small enterprises and exempt micro enterprises(Rbn) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Explanation:
The table provides information on the B-BBEE level for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. However, the specific B-BBEE level for South Africa in the year 2021 is given as "Level1," but the table does not explicitly state the B-BBEE level without the word "Level." Therefore, the exact answer to the question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

The specific question asks for the Fatal-injury frequency rate in the year 2021, which is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows that the Fatal-injury frequency rate for 2021 is "nil," but it does not give the exact number of fatalities per 200,000 person hours worked for that year. Therefore, the answer to the specific question is not directly retrievable from the context.

Explanation:
The table provided does not contain a specific row or indicator for "Employee diversity (%) - Total women employees." The closest related information is "Internal promotions of which are women," which indicates the percentage of women in internal promotions, not the total percentage of women employees in the organization. Therefore, the exact answer to the question is not directly retrievable from the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-09 17:53:56.125 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Employee bursaries (number of bursaries) value is given as 1148.

Explanation:
The table provided only contains information about the number of internships and face-to-face hours of instruction for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. It does not provide specific data on Learnerships for unemployed individuals or individuals with disabilities for the year 2021. Since the table does not mention Learnerships or provide data specific to the question asked, the answer to the question cannot be found in the given context.

Answer:

The specific question asks for the Employee turnover in the year 2021. In the provided table, there is no direct mention of "Employee turnover" as an indicator. The closest related indicator is "Voluntary attrition," which provides data on the percentage of employees leaving the company voluntarily. While this can be an aspect of turnover, it does not provide a comprehensive view of turnover, which may also include involuntary separations.

Therefore, the exact answer to the question about Employee turnover in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the context.

2024-03-09 17:55:19.015 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provides information on the number of non-executive directors for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. However, it specifically mentions "Non-executive directors" without distinguishing between different types (e.g., independent non-executive directors). Therefore, it does not provide the specific number of "Non-executive directors" for the year 2021. The table only shows the total number of non-executive directors, which is 1 for 2021. 

Conclusion:
No.

Consider the following markdown tables:

|-------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| Executive directors     | =       |      2 |      2 |      2 |      3 |

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Non-executive directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

If the answer is not directly retrievable from the context, your conclusion should be 'no'.
Think step by step, and explain your reasoning.
Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.
Before concluding 'yes', please double-check that the answer to the EXACT question is directly available in the context.

Are you sure that '187237.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO_{2} ) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 17:55:39.534 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2) for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 187237.

Answer:

2024-03-09 17:55:58.714 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The markdown table provided does not contain any information related to air emissions of pollutants such as NOx. The table only includes indicators like intensity ratio and carbon emissions per m2 of office space. Therefore, the specific air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021 cannot be found in this table.

No.

Answer:

2024-03-09 17:56:00.714 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The specific question asks for the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021. However, the provided markdown table only includes information about Carbon emissions, specifically Total carbon emissions in tonnes of CO2 for the years 2018 to 2022. There is no mention of NOx emissions in the table, let alone the specific value for NOx emissions in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the given context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 17:56:17.153 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The markdown table provided does not contain any information related to air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The table only includes data on carbon emissions per m2 of office space and water consumption. Since there is no mention of VOC emissions in the table, the specific question regarding the air emissions of VOCs in the year 2021 cannot be answered based on the information provided in the table.

No.

Explanation:
The table provided does not contain information about the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for contract employees in the year 2021. The table only includes data on work-related injuries, which is not directly related to the average number of hours of training. Therefore, the specific question regarding the average number of hours of training for contract employees in 2021 cannot be answered based on the information provided in the table.

Explanation:
The specific question asks for the percentage of black board members in the year 2021.

There is no direct mention of the percentage of black board members in the table. Therefore, the answer to the specific question cannot be found in the given context.
