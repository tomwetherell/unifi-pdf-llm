Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the SO2 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:35:16.009 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 are explicitly provided:

1. Table 1:
   - SO2 emissions are provided, but there is no specific mention of the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

2. Table 2:
   - SO2 emissions are provided, but there is no specific mention of the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - Total CO2 equivalent emissions are provided, but there is no mention of SO2 emissions or the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, we do not have explicit information about the SO2 emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the SO2 emissions in the year 2021?" is 'no'.

Are you sure that '20.298' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Finance cost per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:35:20.848 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row for the year 2021 states "Borrowings 25" with a value of 20.298 R million. This indicates the amount of borrowings for the year 2021, not the finance cost. The finance cost is typically a separate line item on the income statement.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the finance cost per income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:35:24.928 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only mentions improvements in safety indicators and the lowest fatal injury frequency rate in the Group's history of 0.033 per million hours worked. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine the exact frequency/incident rates for the year 2021.

For the second table, the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The table mentions improvements in safety indicators and safeguarding the lives of employees daily, but it does not specify the exact frequency/incident rates for the year 2021.

For the third table, the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 0.04 for the fatal injury frequency rate. This value corresponds to the year 2021 for Sibanye-Stillwater SA gold operations.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:35:32.992 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021. The table only provides information on GHG emissions intensity and total CO2 equivalent emissions for scope 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, it is not possible to determine if '2.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Emissions intensity for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no explicit mention of the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021. The table provides data on total CO2 equivalent emissions for scope 1 and 2, as well as GHG emissions intensity for scope 1 and 2. Similar to the first table, the second table does not provide the specific information needed to confirm if '2.0' is the correct answer for the Emissions intensity in 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, the row related to the year 2021 is not provided. The table only includes information on total CO2 equivalent emissions for scope 1 and 2 under the "Environment" category. Therefore, based on the content of the third table, it is also not possible to determine if '2.0' is the correct answer for the Emissions intensity in 2021.

In conclusion, based on the information presented in the three tables, it is not possible to confirm if '2.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '31.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Female directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:35:55.548 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the year 2021 or any indication of the number of female directors for that year. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of female directors in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of female directors or the year 2021. The information provided in this table does not help us determine the number of female directors in the year 2021.

In the third table, it is mentioned that the Board aims to maintain a balance between male and female Board members, with 9 male and 4 female members. However, this information does not specify the number of female directors in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '31.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the number of female directors in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:36:00.133 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the % of local procurement is given as 39. This table does not provide the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the % of local procurement is given as 39. This table also does not provide the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the % of local procurement is not provided, and the year 2021 is not included in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine the % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021 from this table.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we do not have the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the % of total procurement (Average of SA region) in the year 2021?" is no.

Answer:

Therefore, we cannot determine the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for 4E PGM production, similarly, there is no information provided about carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021 from this table.

Finally, looking at the third table for Production, the table only provides information about Ore milled and not about carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot determine the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '66.067' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total assets in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:36:28.298 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Total assets in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - US dollar - 2021: 5.531
   - SA rand - 2021: 88.163
   - Total assets in 2021: 5.531 million USD + 88.163 million SA rand

2. Table 2:
   - US dollar - 2021: 14
   - SA rand - 2021: 222
   - Total assets in 2021: 14 million USD + 222 million SA rand

3. Table 3:
   - US dollar - 2021: 57
   - SA rand - 2021: 64.831
   - Total assets in 2021: 57 million USD + 64.831 million SA rand

Calculating the total assets in 2021 from each table:
1. 5.531 + 88.163 = 93.694 million
2. 14 + 222 = 236 million
3. 57 + 64.831 = 121.831 million

Therefore, the correct total assets in the year 2021 are:
- Table 1: 93.694 million
- Table 2: 236 million
- Table 3: 121.831 million

Based on the calculations, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total assets in the year 2021?" is **no**. The correct total assets in the year 2021 vary depending on the table being considered.

Are you sure that '38.228' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Water used in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:36:34.403 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the water used in the year 2021. The values provided in the table are related to data integrity, ownership, disclosure, and performance improvement, but not water usage.

Moving on to the second table, in the row corresponding to the year 2021, the value provided for "Water used - Water used" is 38.228. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, the water used in the year 2021 is indeed 38.228.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '16442.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total BEE procurement spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:36:55.127 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total socioeconomic development (SED) spend for the Sibanye-Stillwater Group is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of the Total socioeconomic development (SED) in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Total socioeconomic development (SED) score for the year 2021 is given as 2.14. This score represents the performance in the category of Socioeconomic development for the year 2021, not the actual spend in monetary terms.

Considering the information available in the tables, we cannot determine the Total socioeconomic development (SED) spend for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:36:59.914 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
The Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 value is not provided for the year 2021 in the table, so we cannot determine if '7.302' is the correct answer.

For the second table:
The Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 value is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table, so we cannot determine if '7.302' is the correct answer.

For the third table:

The value '7.302' is mentioned in parentheses, but it is not clear if this corresponds to the year 2021.

Are you sure that '40.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:03.907 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the carbon tax expense in the year 2021:

Table 1:
- There is no specific mention of the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 in this table.

Table 2:
- The carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is mentioned as "R3.4m/US$0.2m" in the row corresponding to the year in question.
- Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on Table 2 is "R3.4m/US$0.2m".

Table 3:
- There is no mention of the carbon tax expense in this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" is not '40.3'. The correct answer is "R3.4m/US$0.2m" as mentioned in Table 2.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:32.854 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table, we can see that the row corresponding to the year 2021 is:

| Market capitalisation | at 31 December 2021 | R137.9 billion |

This row provides information about the market capitalization for the year 2021, not the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues. Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '25.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:40.531 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

The amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows the total paid to Sibanye-Stillwater beneficiaries for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of fines paid or payable in 2021 from this table.

For the second markdown table:

The amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not mentioned in this table either. This table specifically focuses on closure liabilities for US PGM operations and does not provide information on fines paid or payable due to settlements.

For the third markdown table:

The table does not contain any information related to fines paid or payable due to settlements. It discusses benchmarks related to closure liability reduction initiatives but does not mention fines.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot determine that '25.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:48.807 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row corresponding to the year in question does not provide any value for the "Total land area protected" in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, it is not possible to determine the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question also does not provide any value for the "Total land area protected" in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, it is not possible to determine the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021.

Looking at the third table, the row corresponding to the year in question does provide a value for the "Total land area protected" in the year 2021, which is 0. Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table, the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is 0.

Are you sure that '18.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:52.832 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not provided in the table, so we cannot determine the Average hours of training for that year.

For the second table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not provided in the table, so we cannot determine the Average hours of training for that year.

For the third table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not provided in the table, so we cannot determine the Average hours of training for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Average hours of training in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '764.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:37:56.469 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for Human resources development in 2022, the row for Leadership development shows that the total training hours for that program in 2022 is 764. This value does not correspond to the year 2021, so it does not provide the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '16442.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:38:02.080 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from this table.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no explicit mention of the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021. Hence, we cannot find the answer from this table either.

Finally, in the third table, the data provided is related to Total discretionary procurement, 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend, and the percentage of BEE procurement for the years 2021 and 2020. However, this table does not specify the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine that the correct answer to the question is '16442.0'.

Are you sure that '70.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:38:05.386 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2021:

|      | Total discretionary procurement (Rm)   | 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm)   |   % of BEE procurement |
|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2021 | R23,496                                | R16,442                                  |                     70 |

The BEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) is not explicitly provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of BEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the younger than 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:38:16.566 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question does not explicitly mention the number of directors younger than 50.
- The table provides information about the age ranges of directors but does not specify the exact number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question mentions "1 younger than 50."
- This indicates that there was at least one director younger than 50 in the year 2021.

For the third table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question does not explicitly mention the number of directors younger than 50.
- The table focuses on promoting directors from different races and cultures and the age mix of directors but does not provide a specific number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables:
- The correct answer to the question "What was the younger than 50 in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Therefore, the total number of directors between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021 is 2 + 10 = 12.

For the second table:
- There are 2 directors between 50 and 60 years old.
