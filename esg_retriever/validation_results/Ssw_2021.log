Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the SO2 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:42.506 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 are explicitly provided:

1. Table 1:
   - SO2 emissions are provided, but there is no specific mention of the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

2. Table 2:
   - SO2 emissions are provided, but there is no specific mention of the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

3. Table 3:
   - Total CO2 equivalent emissions are provided, but there is no mention of SO2 emissions or the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the SO2 emissions for the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the provided tables, we do not have explicit information about the SO2 emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the SO2 emissions in the year 2021?" is 'no'.

Looking at the second table, the Cost of sales is not mentioned at all. Therefore, we cannot determine the Cost of sales for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Cost of sales is not mentioned at all. Therefore, we cannot determine the Cost of sales for 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '20.298' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Finance cost per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:50.891 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine if '20.298' is the correct answer based on this table.

Looking at the second table, the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '20.298'. Therefore, based on this table, '20.298' is indeed the correct answer to the question.

Concluding, based on the information provided in the second table, the finance cost per income statement in the year 2021 is '20.298'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:42:56.646 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first markdown table, the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table mentions improvements in safety indicators and the lowest fatal injury frequency rate in the Group's history of 0.033 per million hours worked, but it does not specify the frequency/incident rates for the year 2021.

In the second markdown table, the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The table mentions improvements in safety indicators and safeguarding the lives of employees daily, but it does not mention the specific frequency/incident rates for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '4.36' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (Average of SA Region) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:01.028 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for Sibanye-Stillwater SA PGM operations, the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the Serious injury frequency rate and Fatal injury frequency rate for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that '4.36' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:16.912 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Representation of HDP3 in Junior management for the year 2023 is provided as 76.51%. However, the question is asking for the representation in the year 2021, and there is no data provided for the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, based on the information given in the first table, we cannot determine the Representation (HDP South Africans) - Junior management (Average of SA region) in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the Representation of HDP3 in Executive management for the year 2023 is provided as 42.42%. Again, there is no data provided for the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, based on the information given in the second table, we cannot determine the Representation (HDP South Africans) - Junior management (Average of SA region) in the year 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, the Representation of HDP women as % of total HDPs Employees with disabilities in Middle management for the year 2023 is provided as 46.00%. Once more, there is no data provided for the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, based on the information given in the third table, we cannot determine the Representation (HDP South Africans) - Junior management (Average of SA region) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '31.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Female directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:25.573 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the year 2021 or any indication that the values provided are for that year. Therefore, we cannot determine the Female directors in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of Female directors or any indication of the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Female directors in the year 2021 from this table.

In the third table, it is stated that there are 4 Female board members out of a total of 13 board members. Therefore, the percentage of Female directors in the year 2021 would be 4/13 * 100 = 30.77%, which is rounded to 31%.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Female directors in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Yes

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:29.685 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the % of total procurement in the year 2021 for the SA region.

### Table 1:
- Year 2021:
  - Total procurement: 439
  - Local procurement spend: 173
  - % of local procurement: 39

The % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

### Table 2:
- Year 2021:
  - Total procurement: 439
  - Local procurement spend: 173
  - % of local procurement: 39

The % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table.

### Table 3:
- Year 2021:
  - Total procurement: Not provided
  - Local procurement spend: Not provided
  - % of local procurement: Not provided

Based on the information available in the tables, the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in any of the tables. Therefore, I cannot confirm that '42.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '172.194' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Revenue in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:37.122 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the Income statement, the Revenue for the year 2021 is stated as 172.194 R million. Therefore, the Revenue in the year 2021 was indeed 172.194 R million.

Looking at the second table for Profit for the period, the Profit for the period in 2021 is stated as 33.796 US dollars. This does not provide the Revenue for the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for Deferred revenue, the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Revenue in the year 2021 is 172.194 R million.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:43:40.157 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table for the year 2021, we can see that the Share-based payment expense is listed as (383) in US dollars and (218) in SA rand. Since the question specifically asks for the Share-based payment expense per income statement in the year 2021, we should consider the value in SA rand, which is (218). Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Share-based payment expense per income statement in the year 2021?" is not 383.0, but rather 218.0.

1. Table 1:
   - US dollar - 2021: 5.531
   - SA rand - 2021: 88.163
   - Total assets in 2021: 5.531 million USD + 88.163 million SA rand = 93.694 million USD (converted to USD)
   - The value of 66.067 is not explicitly provided in Table 1 for the year 2021.
   
2. Table 2:

Are you sure that '38.228' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Water used in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:44:00.390 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 shows the following values for water used:

- Group US operations: 23.666
- SA PGM operations: Not provided
- SA gold operations: Not provided

Therefore, the total water used in the year 2021 from the second table is 23.666.

So, the correct answer to the question "What was the Water used in the year 2021?" based on the second table is 23.666.

Yes

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

The Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease value for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 30. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the year 2021?" is '30.0'.

For the second markdown table:

The Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease value for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 30. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the year 2021?" is '30.0'.

For the third markdown table, the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the year 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '130.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the No. of employees including contractors – total in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:44:13.210 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, specifically the row for the year 2021, we can see that the total number of employees including contractors is not explicitly provided. The values for 2021 are left blank in the table, so we cannot determine the exact number of employees including contractors for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that '130.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the number of employees including contractors – total in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '2.14' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total socioeconomic development (SED) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:44:25.236 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific value provided for the Total socioeconomic development (SED) spend in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the Total socioeconomic development (SED) in 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the value provided for the Socioeconomic development in 2021 is 2.14. This value corresponds to the Socioeconomic development element and not specifically to the Total socioeconomic development (SED) spend. Therefore, based on the information given in the second table, we cannot confirm that 2.14 is the correct answer to the question regarding the Total socioeconomic development (SED) in the year 2021.

Conclusively, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively determine the Total socioeconomic development (SED) spend in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '7.302' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total CO2e emissions: Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:44:30.566 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
The Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 value is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine if '7.302' is the correct answer for the Total CO2e emissions in 2021 based on this table.

For the second table:
The Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 value is explicitly stated as '6,686Mt CO2e' for the year 2021 in the table. Therefore, '7.302' is not the correct answer for the Total CO2e emissions in 2021 based on this table.

For the third table:
The Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 value is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine if '7.302' is the correct answer for the Total CO2e emissions in 2021 based on this table.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '40.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:44:35.170 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the carbon tax expense in the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - There is no specific mention of a carbon tax expense for the year 2021 in this table. The values provided are for R3.4m/US$0.2m in the current year and R4m/US$0.3m in the previous year. Therefore, we cannot determine the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 from this table.

2. **Table 2**:
   - The carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is mentioned as R3.4m/US$0.2m in this table. There is no mention of a value of '40.3' in this table, so the correct answer is not '40.3'.

3. **Table 3**:
   - There is no mention of a carbon tax expense in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 from this table.

Based on the analysis of the individual tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" is **not '40.3'**.

**Conclusion: No**

| Market capitalisation | at 31 December 2021 | R137.9 billion |

Are you sure that '137.9' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:04.509 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, we can see that the row for "Market capitalisation at 31 December 2021" shows a value of R137.9 billion. However, this value represents the market capitalisation and not the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '485.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:10.023 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the amount of assets under management that employ social issues is not explicitly provided. The table only shows figures for non-current assets in US dollars and SA rand for that year.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the row for "Goodwill and other intangibles" shows a figure of 485 million US dollars. This figure does not represent the amount of assets under management that employ social issues. It specifically refers to goodwill and other intangibles.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '25.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:15.354 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows the total amount paid to Sibanye-Stillwater beneficiaries for each year, which is 25 in 2021. This amount does not specifically indicate fines paid or payable due to settlements.

For the second table:

The table does not contain any information related to fines paid or payable due to settlements. It focuses on closure liabilities for US PGM operations.

For the third table:

The table does not mention anything about fines paid or payable due to settlements. It provides benchmarks related to closure liability reduction initiatives.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not possible to determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:23.410 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row corresponding to the year in question is "Total land area protected," and the value provided is "0." Therefore, the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is indeed "0.0" according to this table.

Looking at the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question is also "Total land area protected," and the value provided is "0." Therefore, the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is "0.0" according to this table as well.

In the third table, there is no specific row for "Total land area protected" for the year in question. Therefore, we cannot determine the Area of forestland with protected conservation status from this table.

Are you sure that '18.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:27.709 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is "Core skills training" with an average hour/learner of 18.
- Therefore, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 for this table is 18.

For the second table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the Average hours of training in the year 2021 for this table.

For the third table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is "Core skills training" with an average hour/learner of 18.
- Therefore, the Average hours of training in the year 2021 for this table is 18.

Are you sure that '764.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:32.239 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2022, the row corresponding to "Leadership development" shows a total training hours of 764. This value represents the total training hours for that specific program in 2022. However, the question is asking for the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per year in the year 2021, not 2022.

Since the table provided does not contain information specifically for the year 2021, we cannot determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues for that year based on the given data.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '16442.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:40.281 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), or Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the BBBEE procurement spend from these specific categories based on the information provided in the first table.

Moving on to the second table, again, there is no explicit mention of the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, or Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021. The focus of this table is on training and development programs, funding initiatives, and job creation, rather than specific procurement spend details.

Finally, in the third table, the information provided is related to total discretionary procurement, HDP Local BEE procurement spend, and the percentage of BEE procurement for the years 2020 and 2021. The BEE procurement spend for the year 2021 is stated as R16,442 million, which represents the total HDP Local BEE procurement spend for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021?" is **No**. The specific value for this category of procurement spend is not explicitly stated in the tables for the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '70.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:43.669 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2021:

The BEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) is not explicitly provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of BEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:48.319 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only shows the B-BBEE level for 2022 as 7. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is explicitly stated as 7.0. So, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is 7.

In the third table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only shows the B-BBEE level for 2022 as 6. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the younger than 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:54.916 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question does not explicitly mention the number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.
- The information provided in the table does not specify the exact number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine the exact number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question mentions "1 younger than 50."
- This indicates that there is at least one director younger than 50 in the year 2021 according to the information provided in the second table.

For the third table:
- The row corresponding to the year in question does not explicitly mention the number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.
- The information provided in the table does not specify the exact number of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'yes' based on the information provided in the second table.

Are you sure that '12.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:45:59.228 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. In the first table, for the year 2021, it states "2 between 50 and 60" and "10 older than 60". Therefore, the total number of directors between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021 is 2 + 10 = 12.

2. In the second table, for the year 2021, it states "2 between 50 and 60" and "1 younger than 50". There is no mention of directors older than 60 in this table for the year 2021.

3. In the third table, for the year 2021, it states "2 Other nationalities" but does not provide information on the age range of directors.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the total number of directors between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021 is 12.0.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.
