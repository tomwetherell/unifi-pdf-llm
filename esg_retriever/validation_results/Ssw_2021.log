Answer:

The unit of measurement for SO2 emissions is "Tonnes SO2," and the boundary for this data is specified as "United States PGM and South Africa PGM smelting operations." 

Since the table does not provide specific data for the year 2021 or any numerical values for SO2 emissions, we cannot directly determine the SO2 emissions in the year 2021 from this table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:42:13.380 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a row or column that specifically mentions this metric. In the provided table, there is no row or column that directly states the Cost of sales. The closest relevant information we have is the "All-in sustaining cost" row, which provides the cost per kilogram for different units.

The "All-in sustaining cost" represents the total cost incurred to produce an ounce of gold, including all costs related to production. However, it does not directly represent the Cost of sales as per the income statement, which typically includes additional expenses such as distribution costs, administrative expenses, and other operating costs.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021.

In the provided markdown table, there is no direct mention of Salaries and wages paid in the year 2021. The table primarily discusses different components of remuneration such as Total guaranteed pay (TGP), Short-term incentives (STI), and Long-term incentives (LTI). These components focus on base salary, allowances, incentives, and share price-linked awards, but they do not explicitly refer to Salaries and wages paid in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information in the table, the answer to the question "What was the Salaries and wages paid in the year 2021?" cannot be found in this markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:42:51.810 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled in the year 2021, we need to calculate the emissions per tonne milled for the SA region in 2021. 

The Emissions intensity is calculated as Emissions (in tonnes) / Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated). 

For the SA region in 2021:
Emissions (in tonnes) = 1.743
Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated) = 38.8

Therefore, Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled in 2021 = 1.743 / 38.8 = 0.0449 tCO2e/t milled

Based on the provided table, we can indeed find the answer to the question.

1. First, we need to find the total emissions in tonnes for the SA region in 2021. From the table, we see that the 2021 Emissions in tonnes for the SA region is 1,388.

2. Next, we need to find the total tonnes milled or treated in 2021. Unfortunately, the table does not provide this information directly. We would need additional data on the total tonnes milled or treated in 2021 for the SA region to calculate the Emissions intensity.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly calculate the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2 e/t milled in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '38.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO_{2} e/t milled in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:43:03.388 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: To find the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021, we need to divide the total emissions in tonnes by the total tonnes milled or treated for that year.

From the table provided:
- 2021 Emissions in tonnes for SA region: 1.743
- 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated) for SA region: 38.8

To convert the emissions from grams to tonnes, we need to divide the emissions in grams by 1,000,000 (since 1 tonne = 1,000,000 grams).

So, the emissions in tonnes for 2021 would be 38.8 / 1,000,000 = 0.0000388

Now, to calculate the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for 2021:
Emissions intensity = Total emissions in tonnes / Total tonnes milled or treated
Emissions intensity = 1.743 / 0.0000388 ≈ 44.94 tCO2e/t milled

Therefore, the correct Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021 is approximately 44.94.

Conclusion: No, '38.8' is not the correct answer to the question.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:43:10.549 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the SA Region in the year 2021, we need to look at the columns related to the SA operations for the respective years. Since we are interested in the year 2021, we should focus on the 2020 data for the SA operations.

Looking at the table, we can see that the LTIFR for the SA operations in 2020 was 5.37 for PGM and 5.65 for Gold. However, these values are for the year 2020 and not for 2021.

Therefore, based on the provided table, we cannot directly determine the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the SA Region in the year 2021.

In the given table, we have data for two types of injuries (strains/soft tissue injuries and slips/trips/falls) for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, the table does not provide the total number of employees for each year, which is necessary to calculate the MTIFR.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:43:40.777 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: Yes

Explanation:
1. Identify the row that corresponds to the question: "Highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) patients on treatment and in active employment N in the year 2021."
2. Look at the values under the columns for the years 2020 and 2019 to see if there is any data for the year 2021.
3. In this case, the row for "Highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) patients on treatment and in active employment" has values for the years 2020 and 2019, but not for 2021.
4. Since there is no specific data for the year 2021 in the table, the answer to the question cannot be found in this markdown table.

2024-03-09 15:43:53.911 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the "Other costs" as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to look at the row that corresponds to "Other costs" or a similar category in the table. However, in the provided table, there is no specific row labeled "Other costs." The closest categories we have are "Spend on accommodation maintenance/renovations (excluding labour costs)" and "Family 1."

The values provided under "Family 1" for the years 2021 and 2020 are 107 and 156, respectively. These values represent the costs associated with Family 1 and not necessarily the overall "Other costs" as per the income statement.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the "Other costs" as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:44:18.036 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Representation (HDP South Africans) - Middle management (Average of SA region) in the year 2021, we need to look at the table for the year 2020 and 2019 to understand the trend and then make an assumption for the year 2021.

Looking at the table, we see that the Representation (HDP South Africans) for Top management (Board) in 2020 was 42.0% for the SA Operations - PGM and 40.0% for the SA Operations - Gold. In 2019, the percentages were 45.5% for SA operations - PGM and 45.5% for SA operations - Gold.

Based on this data, we can see that there was a decrease in representation from 2019 to 2020 for both SA Operations - PGM and SA Operations - Gold. Therefore, if we were to make an assumption for 2021, we might expect a further decrease in representation for Middle management (Average of SA region) compared to 2020.

So, the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the table, but we can make an assumption based on the trend observed in the data provided.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:44:36.920 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for "Female directors" states that it is 31%. This percentage does not directly provide the exact number of female directors in the year 2021. It only indicates the proportion of female directors relative to the total number of directors. Without knowing the total number of directors, we cannot determine the exact number of female directors in the year 2021 based on this information.

Looking at the second table, there is no specific mention of the number of female directors in the year 2021. The table provides information about the gender balance on the board but does not give a numerical value for the female directors in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively say that the number of female directors in the year 2021 was 31.0.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:44:43.868 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021, we need to calculate the total procurement for the SA region, which is the sum of Closure liability3 - Gross liability R million, Closure liability3 - Cash funded R million, and Closure liability3 - Guarantee Funding R million for both SA PGM operations and Total SA operations.

For SA PGM operations:
Total procurement = 6.227 + 655 + 4.891 = 11.773

For Total SA operations:
Total procurement = 11.238 + 3.551 + 7.173 = 21.962

Therefore, the total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021 is 11.773 + 21.962 = 33.735

To find the % of total procurement for the SA region in the year 2021, we need to calculate the average of the SA region's total procurement, which is (11.773 + 21.962) / 2 = 16.868

Now, we can calculate the % of total procurement (Average of SA region) in the year 2021 by dividing the total procurement for the SA region by the average total procurement and multiplying by 100:

% of total procurement (Average of SA region) = (16.868 / 33.735) * 100 ≈ 50%

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the % of total procurement (Average of SA region) in the year 2021?" can be found in the provided markdown table.

2024-03-09 15:44:52.145 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: Yes, the answer to the question can be found in the table. 

To find the Women in the workforce / Women in Mining (WiM) for the SA region in the year 2021, we need to look at the columns for the SA operations - PGM and SA operations - Gold for the year 2020. The values in these columns represent the percentage of women in the workforce or women in mining for the SA region in the year 2020.

The values for 2020 - SA operations - PGM and 2020 - SA operations - Gold are 12.0% and 12.0% respectively. Therefore, the average of these two values would be (12.0 + 12.0) / 2 = 12.0%.

So, the Women in the workforce / Women in Mining (Average of SA region) in the year 2021 is 12.0%.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the provided markdown table.

In this table, the column headers represent different years (2021 and 2022) and the row values represent different financial categories.

Since we are looking for the Revenue in the year 2021, we should focus on the "US dollar - 2021" column. However, the values in this column correspond to "Deferred revenue" and "Tax and royalties payable" categories, not the total Revenue.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:45:57.019 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021, we need to look at the 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated) column in the table for the respective region or operation. In this case, we are interested in the SA gold operations row.

The value for 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated) for SA gold operations is 12.5. This value represents the grams of carbon dioxide emissions per tonne of ore milled in 2021. To convert this to tonnes, we need to divide this value by 1,000 (since there are 1,000 grams in a kilogram, and 1,000 kilograms in a tonne).

So, 12.5 grams per tonne is equal to 0.0125 tonnes per tonne milled.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021?" for SA gold operations is 0.0125 tonnes.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:46:17.349 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total assets in the year 2021, we need to look for the row that corresponds to Total assets and then find the value under the column for the year 2021. In the given table, there is no specific row labeled "Total assets." However, Total assets are typically a combination of various asset categories such as Right-of-use assets and Goodwill and other intangibles.

Looking at the table, we can see that the figures for Right-of-use assets and Goodwill and other intangibles are provided for both 2021 and 2022. To calculate the Total assets in the year 2021, we would need to sum up the values for Right-of-use assets and Goodwill and other intangibles for the year 2021.

Adding the values for Right-of-use assets and Goodwill and other intangibles in the year 2021:
Right-of-use assets (2021) = 14 (in million USD)
Goodwill and other intangibles (2021) = 7.727 (in million USD)

Total assets (2021) = Right-of-use assets (2021) + Goodwill and other intangibles (2021)
Total assets (2021) = 14 + 7.727 = 21.727 million USD

Therefore, the Total assets in the year 2021 can be calculated from the provided information in the table.

The Total assets are typically represented by the sum of Current assets and Inventories.

From the table:
- Current assets in US dollars for 2021 is 4.067
- Inventories in US dollars for 2021 is 1.573
- Current assets in SA rand for 2021 is 64.831
- Inventories in SA rand for 2021 is 25.08

To find the Total assets in US dollars for 2021, we add the Current assets and Inventories:
Total assets in US dollars for 2021 = 4.067 + 1.573 = 5.64

To find the Total assets in SA rand for 2021, we add the Current assets and Inventories:
Total assets in SA rand for 2021 = 64.831 + 25.08 = 89.911

Therefore, the Total assets in the year 2021 can be found in the table, and the values are 5.64 in US dollars and 89.911 in SA rand.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:47:00.019 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the answer to the question "What was the Water used in the year 2021?" in the provided markdown table, we need to look at the row that provides information about water usage. In this case, the row that mentions "Total water withdrawn" is the relevant one.

The unit of measurement for water withdrawn is given as '000 ML, which likely stands for megaliters. This unit indicates the volume of water withdrawn in thousands of megaliters.

Since the question specifically asks about water usage in the year 2021, we need to ensure that the data in the table corresponds to that year. Unfortunately, the table does not specify the year for which these sustainability metrics are reported. Without this information, we cannot definitively state the water usage for the year 2021 based on this table alone.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

The table provides information on gold production and water usage in different units for various mines. However, the table does not directly mention water usage or consumption in any of the cells. The units mentioned in the table are ounces (oz) and kilograms (kg), which are typically used to measure gold production and not water usage.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the water used in the year 2021. The table does not contain specific data related to water consumption for that year.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:47:06.866 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

| Selected sustainability information   | Unit of measurement   | Boundary                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Total water withdrawn                 | '000 ML               | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

The table does not provide any specific information about the water used in the year 2021. It only mentions the total water withdrawn in '000 ML for the Sibanye-Stillwater Group. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table, we cannot determine the water used in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table:

| Selected sustainability information   | Unit of measurement   | Boundary                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Diesel                                | TJ                    | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

Similarly, the second table does not mention any specific information about the water used in the year 2021. It only provides data on the diesel consumption in TJ for the Sibanye-Stillwater Group. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table, we also cannot determine the water used in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, we cannot conclude that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Water used in the year 2021?".

Therefore, the total investment towards rehabilitating land damaged/disturbed by operations in the year 2021 is 326 million US dollars.

Conclusion: No

Now, looking at the markdown table for the SA rand values in 2021 and 2022, we can see that the row related to "Environmental rehabilitation obligation funds" provides the figures for both years. In 2021, the value is 5.202 million, and in 2022, the value is 5.306 million.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '16442.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total BEE procurement spend in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:47:27.311 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: In the first table, for the year 2021, the Total BEE procurement spend is given as R16,442. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total BEE procurement spend in the year 2021?" is indeed R16,442.

In the second table, for the year 2021, the Total BEE procurement spend is also given as R16,442. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, the correct answer to the question is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:47:46.606 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of employees including contractors in the year 2021, we need to look at the column labeled "2021 - Total" in the table. The value in this column represents the total number of employees and contractors for the year 2021.

In the given table, the "2021 - Total" column has values for both the Corporate office and the Group - total rows. To find the total number of employees including contractors for the year 2021, we need to sum up the values in the "2021 - Total" column for both rows.

For the Corporate office row:
2021 - Total = 96 (Employees) + 0 (Contractors) = 96

For the Group - total row:
2021 - Total = 66.005 (Employees) + 18.976 (Contractors) = 84.981

Therefore, the total number of employees including contractors in the year 2021 is the sum of the values from both rows:
Total = 96 (Corporate office) + 84.981 (Group - total) = 180.981

So, the answer to the question "What was the No. of employees including contractors – total in the year 2021?" can be found in the given markdown table, and it is 180.981.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:48:14.375 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Social and Labour Plan (SLP) projects in the year 2021 from the given markdown table, we need to look at the "Current control" and "Planned control enhancement" columns for any mention of SLP projects.

In the "Current control" column, we see that there is a mention of "Deliver Social and labour plans (SLPs)" under the consequence "5. Unproductive workforce." This indicates that there is an existing control related to SLPs for addressing unproductive workforce issues.

In the "Planned control enhancement" column, there are no specific mentions of SLP projects for the year 2021. However, the fact that SLPs are already part of the current control measures suggests that they may continue to be a part of the planned enhancements or activities for the year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we can infer that the Social and Labour Plan (SLP) projects in the year 2021 are related to addressing unproductive workforce issues and are part of the current control measures. While there are no explicit details about new SLP projects in the planned enhancements, the existing mention indicates their ongoing relevance.

1. The table includes information about consequences related to workforce productivity.
2. It mentions the delivery of Social and Labour Plans (SLPs) as part of the current control for addressing unproductive workforce issues.
3. The table does not explicitly state the specific Social and Labour Plan (SLP) projects for the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the table, we can see that it mentions the delivery of SLPs as part of the current control for addressing unproductive workforce issues.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

In this case, the relevant row is:

| Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 | '000 tCO2e            | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

From this row, we can see that the unit of measurement is '000 tCO2e, which stands for thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The boundary specified is the Sibanye-Stillwater Group.

However, the table does not provide the specific value for the Total CO2e emissions for Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021. The table only indicates the category and unit of measurement for the emissions, but the actual numerical value is missing.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the Total CO2e emissions for Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021. The answer is 'no'.

Consider the following markdown tables:

| Selected sustainability information           | Unit of measurement   | Boundary                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 | '000 tCO2e            | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |
| GHG emissions intensity (Scope 1 + 2)         | tCO2e /oz             | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

Are you sure that '2.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total CO2e emissions: Scope 1 and 2 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:48:50.875 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table:

| Selected sustainability information           | Unit of measurement   | Boundary                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 1 and 2 | '000 tCO2e            | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

The table does not provide any specific value for the Total CO2e emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine if '2.0' is the correct answer for the emissions in that year based on this table.

Moving on to the second table:

| Selected sustainability information           | Unit of measurement   | Boundary                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| GHG emissions intensity (Scope 1 + 2)         | tCO2e /oz             | Sibanye-Stillwater Group |

Similarly, this table also does not provide a specific value for the Total CO2e emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm if '2.0' is the correct answer for the emissions in that year based on this table either.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Total CO2e emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No'.

Are you sure that '40.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:49:02.071 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is stated as "R4m/US$0.3m". Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on the first table is 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Looking at the second table, the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is also stated as "R4m/US$0.3m". Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on the second table is also 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on both tables is 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Conclusion: No.

Yes

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:49:47.447 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific pollutant CO (Carbon Monoxide) in the table. In this table, there are two entries related to emissions:

1. GHG emissions intensity (Scope 1 + 2) in tCO2e/oz
2. Total CO2 equivalent emissions: scope 3 in '000 tCO2e

Neither of these entries specifically mentions Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. The first entry refers to greenhouse gas emissions intensity, which includes various gases like CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, etc., but not specifically CO. The second entry also mentions CO2 equivalent emissions, which is different from direct CO emissions.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the specific Air emissions of CO in the year 2021 cannot be found directly.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:49:52.395 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To determine if the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 can be found in the provided markdown table, we need to follow these steps:

1. Look for the "Selected sustainability information" column to find the relevant data category. In this case, we are interested in Air emissions, which may fall under the "Selected sustainability information" category.

2. Check the "Unit of measurement" column to see if there is any mention of particulate matter (PM10) emissions. If there is a specific unit related to PM10 emissions, it would indicate that the data is available in the table.

3. Examine the "Boundary" column to understand the scope or location of the emissions data. If the boundary includes information about the year 2021 or any reference to air emissions, it would suggest that the data for PM10 emissions in 2021 is present.

Based on the provided table, it appears that the table only includes information about SO2 emissions and does not mention particulate matter (PM10) specifically. Additionally, there is no indication of data related to the year 2021 in the table.

However, the table only includes information on GHG emissions intensity and total CO2 equivalent emissions, which are related to greenhouse gases and not specifically to particulate matter (PM10).

Since there is no mention of PM10 or any other air pollutants in the table, we cannot find the answer to the question regarding the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021 in this table.

2024-03-09 15:50:13.528 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific line item related to Administration expenses in the income statement table. However, the provided table only includes information on Adjusted EBITDA for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of a company's operating performance and does not directly provide information on Administration expenses.

Since the table does not contain any specific data related to Administration expenses or any other relevant information that could help us calculate the ALL Administration expenses for 2021, the answer to the question cannot be found in this table.

The closest metrics we have in the table are the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and the Medically Treated Injury Frequency Rate (MTIFR) for the years 2019 and 2020.

The TRIFR and MTIFR represent the frequency of injuries per million hours worked. However, the table does not provide data specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021 from this table.

Specifically, we are interested in the performance related to governance indicators that employ governance issues.

In this table, there are two rows related to governance issues:
1. Governance (30%) - Ethics - Code of conduct
2. Governance (30%) - Corporate governance - Management policies, systems, and disclosure

Both of these rows have performance percentages listed for different time periods. However, the table does not provide information on the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021. The table only shows performance metrics related to governance indicators but does not directly provide the specific information we are looking for.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:50:34.530 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Governance (30%)" row in the table. Specifically, we are interested in the "Indicator" column, which provides information on the management policies, systems, and disclosure related to governance issues.

In the first row under "Governance (30%)" and "Corporate governance", the indicator is "Management policies, systems and disclosure". The performance values provided in the subsequent columns (250%, 250%, 183.3%) likely represent the performance or impact of governance-related policies and systems.

In the second row under "Governance (30%)" and "Compliance", the indicator is "IT Governance, cyber security and data privacy". The performance values provided in the subsequent columns (100% 0%, 100% 0%, 183.3%) also likely represent the performance or impact of compliance-related policies and systems.

However, the table does not directly provide information on the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021. The table focuses on strategic thrusts, indicators, and performance metrics related to governance and compliance, but it does not explicitly state the total assets under management by asset class.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the provided markdown table.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:51:15.282 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021, we need to look at the column headers and row values in the table. In this table, there are two columns related to the year 2021: "US dollar - 2021" and "SA rand - 2021". We need to check if any of the row values under these columns correspond to fines paid or payable due to settlements.

Looking at the row values under the "US dollar - 2021" column, we see that there are values of 58 and 15.162 million. These values are not explicitly labeled as fines paid or payable due to settlements. Similarly, under the "SA rand - 2021" column, we have the values of 58 and 15.162, which also do not indicate fines paid or payable due to settlements.

Based on the information available in the table, there is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

2024-03-09 15:51:35.305 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the area of forestland owned in the year 2021, we need to look at the column corresponding to the year 2021 in the table. However, there seems to be a typo in the table header for the year 2021, as it is written as "20211" instead of "2021". 

Since the table does not have a specific row for "Forestland" or a similar category, we cannot directly determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021 from this table. The table only provides information on "Other" and "Total" areas for the years 2022 and 2021 (assuming the typo is corrected).

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:51:58.551 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average hours of training in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Total training hours" column in the table. This column is calculated by multiplying the "Number of learners" by the "average training days per learner". 

For the "Core skills training" group:
Total training hours = 405,048 learners * 18 average hours per learner = 7,290,864 hours

For the "Cadet training" group:
Total training hours = 1,048 learners * 502 average hours per learner = 526,496 hours

Therefore, the total training hours for the year 2021 would be the sum of the total training hours for both groups:
Total training hours = 7,290,864 hours + 526,496 hours = 7,817,360 hours

So, the answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" can be found in the table, and it is 7,817,360 hours.

For the year 2021, we are interested in the total training hours for all training groups combined. However, the table only provides data for two specific training groups: Cadet training and Coaches/mentorship training.

Answer:

For the group "Cadet training," the total training hours are 67,072 and the number of learners is 1,048. To calculate the average number of hours of training per employee, we divide the total training hours by the number of learners: 67,072 / 1,048 ≈ 64 hours per learner.

For the group "Coaches/mentorship training," the total training hours are 4 and the number of learners is 500. Calculating the average number of hours of training per employee: 4 / 500 = 0.008 hours per learner.

Based on the calculations above, we can see that the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 can be found in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:52:36.626 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2022, the row for "Cadet training" provides the following relevant information:
- Number of learners: 1,048
- Total training hours: 67,072

To calculate the average number of hours of training per learner for "Cadet training" in 2022, we can divide the total training hours by the number of learners:
Average hours per learner = Total training hours / Number of learners
Average hours per learner = 67,072 / 1,048
Average hours per learner ≈ 64

Therefore, the correct average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 for "Cadet training" is approximately 64 hours, not 502 hours as stated in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:52:45.448 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to calculate the percentage of QSE spend out of the total discretionary procurement spend for that year.

In the table provided:
- Total discretionary procurement spend in 2021 was R23,496m
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend in 2021 was R16,442m

To find the BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs, we need to subtract the 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend from the total discretionary procurement spend:
BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs = Total discretionary procurement spend - 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend
BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs = R23,496m - R16,442m = R7,054m

Now, to find the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs as a % of total spend in 2021, we can use the formula:
Percentage = (BBBEE procurement spend from QSEs / Total discretionary procurement spend) * 100
Percentage = (R7,054m / R23,496m) * 100 ≈ 30%

Therefore, the answer to the question is 30%.

In the provided table, the total discretionary procurement spend for 2021 is R23,496m and the 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend is R16,442m. To find the QSE spend, we subtract the BEE procurement spend from the total discretionary procurement spend:

QSE spend = Total discretionary procurement - BEE procurement spend
QSE spend = R23,496m - R16,442m
QSE spend = R7,054m

To find the percentage of QSE spend out of the total spend, we calculate:

Percentage = (QSE spend / Total discretionary procurement) * 100
Percentage = (R7,054m / R23,496m) * 100
Percentage ≈ 30%

Therefore, the answer to the question is 30%.

Are you sure that '70.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:52:55.047 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021:

- Total discretionary procurement (Rm): R23,496
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm): R16,442
- % of BEE procurement: 70

To calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend, we need to divide the BEE procurement spend by the total discretionary procurement and multiply by 100:

(16,442 / 23,496) * 100 ≈ 69.98

So, the correct answer for the year 2021 is approximately 70. It seems that '70.0' is indeed the correct answer.

Now, looking at the second table for the year 2021:

- Total discretionary procurement (Rm): R23,496
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm): R16,442
- % of BEE procurement: 70

The same calculation applies here, and the answer remains the same.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.

The total discretionary procurement spend in 2021 was R23,496 million, and the 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend was R16,442 million. To calculate the percentage of BEE procurement, we can use the formula:

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = \left( \frac{\text{1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend}}{\text{Total discretionary procurement}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values from the table:

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = \left( \frac{16,442}{23,496} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = \left( 0.699 \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = 69.9\% \]

Therefore, the answer to the question is 69.9%.

First, we need to identify the relevant values from the table for the year 2021:
- Total discretionary procurement (Rm) for 2021: R23,496
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm) for 2021: R16,442

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of BEE procurement spend:
Percentage = (BEE procurement spend / Total discretionary procurement) * 100
Percentage = (R16,442 / R23,496) * 100 ≈ 69.98%

Therefore, the answer to the question is 70, without including the word 'Level'.

Are you sure that '7.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:53:16.382 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only provides the scores for 2022 and 2021 without specifying the level for 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot definitively determine that the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in 2021 was '7'.

In the second table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is explicitly stated as '7'. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we can conclude that the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in 2021 was '7'.

In the third table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only provides the scores for 2022 and 2021 without specifying the level for 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table, we cannot definitively determine that the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in 2021 was '7'.

So, the correct answer is: No

From the table:
- There is 1 director younger than 50 years old.
- There are 2 directors between 50 and 60 years old.

To calculate the total number of directors who are between 50 and 60 years old or older than 60, we add the number of directors in each category:
1 (younger than 50) + 2 (between 50 and 60) = 3

Therefore, the total number of directors who are between 50 and 60 years old + older than 60 in the year 2021 is 3.

It mentions that the approved retirement age for directors is 72 years of age, and the Board has reserved the right to extend this to 75 if the member is available and fit to carry out their duties.

However, the table does not explicitly mention any Board members under the age of 30 in the year 2021. It only provides information about the retirement age and the age ranges of the directors.

2024-03-09 15:54:13.770 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific line item related to acquisition costs in the income statement for the year 2021. In the provided table, there is no direct mention of acquisition costs or any specific line item that clearly represents the Cost relating to acquisition.

The closest relevant information in the table is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for the year 2021, which is 68.606 R million. However, EBITDA does not directly represent acquisition costs.

Therefore, based on the information available in the provided markdown table, we cannot determine the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

1. Look for the section or column headers that might contain information related to data security risks or risk management processes.
2. Check the content under those headers to see if there is any specific mention of data security risks or management approaches.

In the given table, the headers are "Our risk management process" and "Governance structures involved." The content under the "Our risk management process" column includes information about analyzing and evaluating risks, understanding root causes, assessing severity and likelihood of risks. However, there is no specific mention of data security risks in this section.

Moving on to the "Governance structures involved" column, we see that there are letters (A, B, C) listed under this column, but they do not provide any direct information about data security risks or management approaches related to data security.

Based on the analysis of the table, the description of the management approach to identifying and addressing data security risks in the year 2021 cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

The table seems to be listing environmental management policies and practices related to governance for active sites. 

Looking at the table, the first column appears to be the category or type of policy or practice, the second column seems to be the specific policy or practice, and the third column is likely additional information or details.

To find the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021, we would need to look for specific information related to environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021. However, the table provided does not contain any information related to the year 2021 or specific descriptions of environmental management policies and practices for active sites.

Therefore, based on the content of the given markdown table, the answer to the question "What was the Description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021?" cannot be found in this table.

1. The table consists of two main sections, each containing bullet points with descriptions of various initiatives or actions taken in different areas such as responsible sourcing, supply chain integrity, safety protocols, environmental sustainability, and social performance.

2. The descriptions in the table primarily focus on topics related to environmental sustainability, safety, social performance, and operational planning. There is no explicit mention of a management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain.

3. The bullet points mention initiatives like reduction in GHG emissions, water intensity, recycling efforts, tailings management, biodiversity preservation, water quality improvements, and emergency preparedness. These topics are related to environmental management and safety rather than anti-corruption measures.

4. The absence of specific references to corruption prevention, bribery prevention, or ethical business conduct indicates that the information needed to answer the question is not present in the provided markdown table.

2024-03-09 15:55:24.419 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the answer to the question regarding the discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021 from the provided markdown table, we need to analyze the content of the table.

1. The first column titled "How we engage" provides information on the methods and platforms used for engagement. In this case, it mentions engagement through industry bodies such as the Minerals Council in South Africa and the National Mining Association in the US. This does not directly address the specific topics of human rights, indigenous rights, or operation in conflict areas.

2. The second column titled "Material issues to both parties in 2022" lists the key concerns for both parties involved. The issues mentioned include compliance and pace, delivery on social and labor plans commitments, B-BBEE compliance, regulatory uncertainty, and illegal mining. While some of these issues may be related to human rights and indigenous rights, the table does not explicitly mention discussions on these topics in the context of engagement processes and due diligence practices.

3. The third column titled "Our response and strategy to enhance the quality of our relationship" is empty in the provided table, so there is no specific information available in this column to address the question.

Based on the analysis of the content in the markdown table, it does not provide a direct answer to the question regarding the discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021.
