Explanation:
The table provided does not contain any information related to Scope 3 in the year 2021. It only mentions aspects related to driving strategies and managing risks within the external environment. Therefore, the specific question about Scope 3 in the year 2021 cannot be answered based on the information provided in the table.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:32:17.862 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question asks for the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in the year 2021, measured in tCO2e/t milled. The table provided includes information on emissions for the SA region in 2021, but it only provides the emissions in grams per tonne milled and the total emissions in tonnes for that year. 

To calculate the Emissions intensity in tCO2e/t milled, we would need the total emissions in tCO2e for the SA region in 2021 and the total amount of material milled or treated in that year. However, the table does not provide the total emissions in tCO2e for the SA region in 2021, which is necessary to calculate the Emissions intensity in tCO2e/t milled.

Therefore, the answer to the specific question cannot be directly retrieved from the context provided in the table.

2024-03-09 18:32:36.645 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the "Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021." However, the provided markdown table only includes data on the number of injuries for strains/soft tissue injuries and slips/trips/falls for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. 

The Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) is a rate that would require additional information such as the total number of employees, the total number of medically treated injuries, and the time period over which these injuries occurred. Since the table does not provide the necessary data to calculate the MTIFR for the year 2021, the answer to the specific question cannot be found in the given context.

Conclusion: No

Explanation:
The table provided only mentions the benchmarks related to environmental incidents for the year 2021, stating whether they were met or not met. It does not explicitly list the specific environmental incidents at level 3 and higher that occurred in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Environmental incidents: level 3 and higher in the year 2021?" cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

The table provided only shows data related to closure liabilities for SA region operations in terms of gross liability, cash funded, and guarantee funding. There is no information provided in the table regarding the % of total procurement in the SA region for the year 2021. Therefore, the specific question about the % of total procurement in the SA region in 2021 cannot be answered directly from the given table.

Conclusion: No.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '184.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the State royalties per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:34:21.846 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the State royalties per income statement are not explicitly provided. The values given in the table for the year 2021 are for Tax and royalties payable and Deferred tax liabilities, not specifically for State royalties.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the value provided under Royalties is (184), which indicates a negative value. This suggests that there was an outflow related to royalties in the income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the State royalties per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 184.0.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:37:03.957 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provided does not contain specific information about the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021. It only mentions SO2 emissions and does not provide any data related to PM10 emissions. Therefore, the specific question regarding PM10 emissions in the year 2021 cannot be answered based on the information given in the table.

Conclusion:
No

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:37:20.644 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021. The table provided includes the "Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR)" for different regions and groups in both 2021 and 2022. However, the MTIFR is not the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate. The All Injury Frequency Rate typically includes all injuries, whether medically treated or not, and is a broader measure of injuries in the workplace.

Since the table only provides the Medically Treated Injury Frequency Rate (MTIFR) and does not explicitly mention the All Injury Frequency Rate or provide the necessary data to calculate it, the specific answer to the question regarding the All Injury Frequency Rate in 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Consider the following markdown tables:

Are you sure that '60.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:37:36.207 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value under the column for 2021 in the row "Environmental stewardship (6%)" is 60. This indicates that the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021 is indeed 60.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021?" is '60.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Explanation:
The markdown table provided does not contain any information related to the area of forestland leased in the year 2021. The table primarily discusses data integrity, closure liability reduction, and establishing baselines for measuring loss/gain based on hectare equivalents. There is no mention of forestland leasing or specific data related to the area of forestland leased in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021?" cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:38:28.996 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provides information about the land under management in two locations, but it does not specify the area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021. The table only mentions the total land area managed in SA and the US, without indicating the specific area designated for protected conservation status. Therefore, the exact answer to the question is not directly available in the context.

No.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:39:21.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the "BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021" without including the word 'Level' in the answer. 

Looking at the provided markdown table, we can see the data for the year 2021:
- Total discretionary procurement (Rm): R23,496
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm): R16,442
- % of BEE procurement: 70

The question is asking for the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. In this table, we have the total discretionary procurement and the BEE procurement spend, but we do not have the specific breakdown of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's. The table only provides the overall BEE procurement spend, which is not specific to BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's.

Therefore, the exact answer to the specific question is not directly retrievable from the context provided in the markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:40:22.459 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provided only shows an extract from the income statement and the statement of cash flows, specifically mentioning the net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents for different years. The table does not directly provide the depreciation amount as per the income statement for the year 2021. Depreciation is a specific line item in the income statement that represents the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives. Since the table does not include the depreciation amount for 2021, the answer to the question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

The table provided only includes information about Adjusted EBITDA for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Depreciation is not explicitly mentioned in this table. While EBITDA can be used as a proxy for operating performance, it does not directly provide the specific figure for depreciation. Therefore, the exact Depreciation amount as per the income statement in the year 2021 cannot be found in this table.

Conclusion: No.
