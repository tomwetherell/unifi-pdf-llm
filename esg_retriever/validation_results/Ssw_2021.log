Answer:

2024-03-10 18:44:04.135 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, the specific question is asking for the SO2 emissions in the year 2021. The table includes an indicator for "SO2 emissions" and specifies the unit of measurement as "Tonnes SO2." Additionally, it mentions the boundary for the SO2 emissions, which is the United States PGM and South Africa PGM smelting operations.

Given that the table explicitly states the indicator "SO2 emissions" and provides the unit of measurement as "Tonnes SO2," along with the boundary information, we can directly retrieve the answer to the question "What was the SO2 emissions in the year 2021?" from the context.

2024-03-10 18:44:21.492 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators such as "Adjusted EBITDA margin" and "All-in sustaining cost," which do not directly represent the Cost of sales.

The indicators provided in the table are related to profitability metrics and costs per unit of production, such as EBITDA margin and all-in sustaining cost per unit. These metrics do not directly correspond to the Cost of sales as per the income statement, which typically includes expenses directly related to the production of goods or services sold.

Without a specific indicator related to the Cost of sales in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Cost of sales as per the income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Finance costs are typically associated with interest expenses on borrowings or other financial liabilities.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:44:43.167 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Finance cost per income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to finance costs in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information about Total liabilities and does not directly provide any details about finance costs or expenses.

Since there is no mention of finance costs or any specific indicator related to finance expenses in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the Finance cost per income statement for the year 2021 from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Finance cost per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:44:46.384 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021, we need to look for specific data related to occupational injuries in the provided markdown table. The table includes information on the number of incidents for different types of injuries (struck by objects and strains/soft tissue injuries) for the years 2021, 2020, and 2022.

However, the table only provides the number of incidents for each type of injury in the respective years. To calculate the incident rates, we would need additional information such as the total number of employees or hours worked to determine the rate of incidents per unit of exposure (e.g., per 100 employees or per 1,000 hours worked).

Since the table does not include the necessary information to calculate the incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:45:03.015 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the emissions intensity for the SA Region in the year 2021, we need to look at the "2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated)" value for the SA region in the provided markdown table. The emissions intensity is typically calculated as emissions (in tonnes) divided by the amount milled (in tonnes), expressed in tCO2e/t milled.

In the table, we have the following relevant information for the SA region in 2021:
- Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated): 38.8
- Emissions in tonnes: 1,743

To calculate the emissions intensity for the SA Region in 2021, we would need to convert the emissions from grams to tonnes and then divide by the amount milled. However, the table does not provide the amount milled for the SA Region in 2021, which is necessary to calculate the emissions intensity.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO2e/t milled in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '0.72' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) - tCO_{2} e/t milled in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:45:14.481 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: To find the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021, we need to look at the 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated) and the 2021 Emissions in tonnes for the SA region in the table provided.

From the table:
- 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated) for SA region: 30.9
- 2021 Emissions in tonnes for SA region: 1,388

To calculate the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for 2021, we need to convert the emissions from grams to tonnes and then divide the total emissions by the total tonnes milled/treated.

First, we convert the emissions from grams to tonnes:
30.9 grams = 0.0309 tonnes

Next, we calculate the Emissions intensity:
Emissions intensity = Total emissions (tonnes) / Total tonnes milled/treated
Emissions intensity = 1,388 tonnes / 0.0309 tonnes = 44,961.17 tCO2e/t milled

Therefore, the Emissions intensity (Average of SA Region) in tCO2e/t milled for the year 2021 is approximately 44,961.17.

Conclusion: No, the correct answer is not 0.72.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:45:33.102 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on the number of incidents for different types of injuries (strains/soft tissue injuries and slips/trips/falls) for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

The table does not directly provide the MTIFR for the year 2021. The MTIFR would require additional information such as the total number of employees, the total number of medically treated injuries, and the calculation of the rate based on this data. Since the necessary data for calculating the MTIFR is not present in the table, we cannot directly determine the MTIFR for the year 2021 from the given context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:45:48.144 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, there is a column titled "Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) Number of fatalities" which seems to contain information related to fatalities. However, the table does not explicitly provide the average number of fatalities for the SA region in the year 2021. The table only mentions the TRIFR and the number of fatalities without specifying the average for the SA region or for the year 2021.

Without a specific entry for the average number of fatalities for the SA region in 2021, we cannot directly retrieve the answer to the question "What was the Fatalities (Average of SA region) in the year 2021?" from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "HAART patients alive and on treatment, total employees including category 3-8 employees" and "Employees who have left HAART programmes."

The indicator "HAART patients alive and on treatment, total employees including category 3-8 employees" provides information on the total number of HAART patients alive and on treatment, but it does not specifically mention the subset of these patients who are in active employment. Without a specific breakdown of the employment status of these patients, we cannot determine the exact number of HAART patients who are both on treatment and in active employment in 2021.

Without a specific line item for "Other costs" or a clear indication that the spending on accommodation maintenance/renovations corresponds to "Other costs," we cannot determine the exact amount of "Other costs" in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Other costs as per the income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '31.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Female directors in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:47:00.553 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for "Female directors" does not specify the year in question. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of female directors in the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the row for "and promotes gender diversity" does not provide a specific number for female directors in the year 2021. Instead, it mentions a balance between male and female board members, with 9 male and 4 female members. This does not give a direct answer to the question about the number of female directors in 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that the correct answer to the question "What was the Female directors in the year 2021?" is '31.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:47:32.714 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the SA region is provided as 7.09, not 5.99. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) (Average for SA Region) in the year 2021?" based on the first table is 7.09, not 5.99.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the SA region is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for TRIFR for the SA region in the year 2021 from the second table.

However, the table only includes information about total liabilities and does not directly mention restructuring costs.

Since restructuring costs are not explicitly listed in the table, we cannot determine the restructuring costs per income statement in the year 2021 directly from the context provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Restructuring costs per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes indicators such as "Debt to equity ratio" and "Dividends declared per share."

There is no direct mention of Share-based payment expense in the table. The indicators provided do not relate to Share-based payment expense specifically. Without a specific line item or indicator related to Share-based payment expense, we cannot determine the exact amount of this expense for the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Share-based payment expense per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes data for the years 2020 and 2019, and it provides information on "Current tax and royalties" for those years in R million.

Since the table does not contain any data for the year 2021, we cannot directly retrieve the State royalties per income statement for that specific year from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the TB rate per 1,000 employees in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes information on emissions in grams per tonne milled/treated for different regions and the corresponding total emissions in tonnes.

For the year 2021, the table provides the following information:
- SA gold operations: 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/treated) = 12.5, 2021 Emissions in tonnes = 190.0
- EU region: No specific data is provided for the 2021 emissions.

Since the table only provides data for SA gold operations in terms of emissions per tonne milled and total emissions for the year 2021, we can directly retrieve the answer for SA gold operations, which is 12.5 grams per tonne milled and 190.0 tonnes of emissions in 2021.

However, for the EU region, there is no data available for the 2021 emissions, so we cannot determine the tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled for the EU region in the year 2021.

2024-03-10 18:48:40.915 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the current tax and royalties in the year 2021, we need to look for specific figures related to tax and royalties in the provided markdown table. The table includes figures for "Profit before royalties, carbon tax, and tax" and figures for "Royalties." However, the table does not explicitly provide a figure for "Current tax" in the year 2021.

The figures provided in the table are related to profit before royalties, carbon tax, and tax, as well as royalties, but they do not directly specify the amount of current tax for the year 2021. Without a specific breakdown of the current tax amount for 2021, we cannot determine the exact figure for current tax from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Current tax and royalties in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:49:27.749 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the amount of water used in the year 2021. In the provided markdown table, the information given is about "Total water withdrawn" and the unit of measurement is '000 ML (megaliters). 

The term "Total water withdrawn" does not directly equate to the total water used. Water withdrawal refers to the total amount of water taken from a water source, which may include water used in processes, consumed, or returned to the environment. It does not provide a clear indication of the actual water consumption or usage.

Without additional information on water consumption, such as water used in processes, consumed by operations, or other relevant details, we cannot determine the exact amount of water used in the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Water used in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:50:16.465 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of employees including contractors - total in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes an indicator labeled "No. of employees including contractors - total2" with data for the year 2020, but there is no specific data provided for the year 2021.

Since the table does not contain the data for the year 2021 under the "No. of employees including contractors - total2" indicator, we cannot directly retrieve the number of employees including contractors - total for the year 2021 from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the No. of employees including contractors – total in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

This indicates that Social and labour plan (SLP) projects were part of the current control measures in response to unproductive workforce consequences.

However, the table does not explicitly state the specific Social and labour plan (SLP) projects that were implemented in the year 2021. It only mentions the delivery of SLPs as part of the current control measures without detailing the specific projects undertaken in 2021.

Therefore, while there is a reference to Social and labour plan (SLP) activities in the table, the specific projects implemented in the year 2021 are not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:50:47.815 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Social and Labour Plan (SLP) projects in the year 2021, we need to look for specific projects related to SLP in the provided markdown table. The table includes consequences related to an unproductive workforce and current and planned control measures.

In the table, it is mentioned that one of the current control measures for addressing the consequence of an unproductive workforce is to "Deliver Social and labour plans (SLPs)." This indicates that SLP projects are part of the current control measures being implemented.

However, the table does not provide specific details or a breakdown of the Social and Labour Plan (SLP) projects for the year 2021. It only mentions the general action of delivering SLPs as a current control measure.

Therefore, while the table acknowledges the presence of SLP projects as part of the current control measures, it does not directly specify the details of the SLP projects for the year 2021.

Answer:

Therefore, we cannot determine the emissions value for the year 2021 from the information given in the first table.

Moving on to the second table, similarly, there is no explicit mention of the year 2021 for the Total CO2 equivalent emissions for Scope 1 and 2. The table does provide the GHG emissions intensity for Scope 1 and 2, but not the total emissions value for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '40.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:51:41.468 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is stated as "R4m/US$0.3m". Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on the first table is 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Looking at the second table, the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is also stated as "R4m/US$0.3m". Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on the second table is also 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on both tables is 'R4m/US$0.3m', not '40.3'.

Conclusion: No

2024-03-10 18:53:00.202 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR), but neither of these directly provides the All Injury Frequency Rate.

The All Injury Frequency Rate is a specific metric that is not explicitly listed in the table. The LTIFR and TRIFR are related to lost-time injuries and total recordable injuries, respectively, but they do not represent the All Injury Frequency Rate as defined in the question.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:54:14.053 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the area of forestland leased in the year 2021, we need to focus on the specific information provided in the markdown table. The table mentions the "Land under management" for two locations: 63,891ha in SA and 1,089ha in the US for the year 2021. However, this information does not explicitly state the area of forestland that was leased in 2021.

The table only provides data on the total land under management for the specified locations, which may include various types of land use beyond just leased forestland. Without a specific breakdown or mention of leased forestland within the total land under management, we cannot directly determine the area of forestland leased in 2021 from the context provided.

In the table, under the "NATURAL CAPITAL" section, it mentions the "Land under management" with specific figures for different regions.

The table provides the information that in 2021, there were 63,891 hectares of land under management in SA and 1,089 hectares in the US. However, it does not explicitly state that this land specifically refers to forestland. The term "Land under management" could encompass various types of land, not just forestland.

Without a clear indication that the land under management specifically refers to forestland, we cannot definitively determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021 based on the information provided in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:54:33.897 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, there is no specific indicator or data related to the "Area of forestland with protected conservation status" in the year 2021. The table includes information on total land area protected and total land rehabilitated, but it does not provide a breakdown of the area of forestland with protected conservation status for the year 2021.

Without a direct mention or specific data point related to the area of forestland with protected conservation status in 2021, we cannot determine the exact area of forestland that had this status during that year based on the information provided in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes the Total discretionary procurement (Rm), 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm), and the % of BEE procurement for the years 2021 and 2022.

In the table, for the year 2021, the Total discretionary procurement was R23,496 million, and the 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend was R16,442 million. The % of BEE procurement was 70%.

The specific question asks for the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. From the table, we can see that the BEE procurement spend is R16,442 million, and the total discretionary procurement is R23,496 million. Therefore, the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 is 70%.

2024-03-10 18:56:16.399 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to look at the provided markdown table. The table includes the columns for "Total discretionary procurement (Rm)," "1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm)," and "% of BEE procurement."

In the table, the "% of BEE procurement" column provides the percentage of BEE procurement spend compared to the total discretionary procurement. However, this column specifically mentions the percentage of BEE procurement and not the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend.

The table does not explicitly mention the specific BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021. Without a breakdown of the EME's contribution to the BEE procurement spend, we cannot determine the exact percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:56:19.929 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: To calculate the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we need to use the formula:

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm)}}{\text{Total discretionary procurement (Rm)}} \right) \times 100 \]

For the year 2021, the values are:
- Total discretionary procurement (Rm) = R23,496
- 1 HDP Local BEE procurement spend (Rm) = R16,442

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \% \text{ of BEE procurement} = \left( \frac{16,442}{23,496} \right) \times 100 \approx 69.98 \]

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 69.98, not 70.0.

However, there is no explicit mention of the number of board members under 30 in the year 2021.

The table includes columns for different years (2022, 2021, 2020) and categories such as 1Employees, Contractors, and Total.

In the table, there are values for "2021 - 1Employees," "2021 - Contractors," and "2021 - Total." The "2021 - Contractors" column likely contains information about costs related to contractors for the year 2021. However, the values in this column are not explicitly labeled as costs, and there is no specific breakdown of what these costs entail.

Without a clear indication that the values in the "2021 - Contractors" column represent contractor costs in the income statement for the year 2021, we cannot definitively state that the answer to the question "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided table.

The table includes information under the "Our risk management process" column, detailing steps such as scanning internal and external environments for new risks and compiling a risk register.

While the table provides some insight into the risk management process, it does not explicitly mention data security risks or provide a detailed description of the management approach specifically related to data security risks. The information provided in the table focuses on general risk identification and management processes without specifying data security risks.

Without a direct mention of data security risks or a detailed description of the management approach for addressing these risks in the year 2021, we cannot retrieve the specific information related to data security risk management from the context.

The table provided only mentions stakeholder engagement activities related to winning over the trust of employees for their new employer through meetings, trainings, and negotiations. It also briefly mentions issues such as culture and values, water management, and a collective agreement negotiation.

However, there is no direct mention of discussions regarding engagement processes and due diligence practices specifically related to human rights, indigenous rights, and operations in areas of conflict in the year 2021. The information provided in the table does not offer details on these specific topics.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes information under the headings of "ACCOUNTABILITY," "GOVERNANCE - RELEVANT LEGISLATION," and "GOVERNANCE - ASSURANCE AND REVIEWS."

Upon reviewing the content under these headings, we find references to legislation related to safety, handling of dangerous chemicals, and oversight mechanisms such as incident and fatality reviews. However, there is no explicit mention of a discussion of the process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021.

The information provided in the table focuses on legislation, governance, and assurance processes related to safety and oversight but does not directly address the specific question about the discussion of the process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Discussion of process to identify and manage emerging materials and chemicals of concern on product safety in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.
