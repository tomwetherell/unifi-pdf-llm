Are you sure that '30.9' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (2) NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:20.839 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the SA region for the year 2021, the value provided is '30.9' grams per tonne milled/treated. This value corresponds to the 2021 emissions for NOx in the SA region.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (2) NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021?" is '30.9'.

Are you sure that '63891.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Land under management in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:26.450 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The Land under management in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as "63,891ha in SA (2021:63,891ha) 1,089ha in US (2021: 650ha)". Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Land under management in the year 2021?" is '63891.0'.

For the second table:

There is no specific mention of the Land under management for the year 2021 in the provided row. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:

Similar to the second table, there is no direct mention of the Land under management for the year 2021 in the provided row. Hence, we cannot ascertain the exact value for the year 2021 from this table.

Yes

Are you sure that '20.298' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Finance cost per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:32.092 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of '20.298' corresponds to borrowings, not finance cost.

In the second table, the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value of '20.298' again corresponds to borrowings, not finance cost.

In the third table, there is no information related to the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot determine the finance cost per income statement for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:36.117 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the years 2020 and 2021, the values for "Struck by objects (tools, equipment and others)" are 13 and 14 respectively. The value for "Strains/soft tissue injuries" is 4 for both years. Therefore, the Frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided as 17.0 in this table.

Looking at the second table, the values provided are not related to the incident rates for occupational injuries, so we can disregard this table for this question.

In the third table, the values for the year 2022 are 0 for "Struck by objects (tools, equipment and others)" and 1 for "Strains/soft tissue injuries". Since this table is for the year 2022 and not 2021, we cannot use these values to determine the incident rates for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Frequency/incident rates of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 17.0.

Are you sure that '5.79' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (Average of SA Region) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Are you sure that '1.08' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:47.359 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021 is provided as 1.08. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021?" is '1.08'.

Looking at the second table, the value for the Medically treated injury frequency rate (MTIFR) in the year 2021 is also provided as 1.08. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in both tables, the correct answer to the question is '1.08'.

Are you sure that '15.16' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) patients on treatment and in active employment N in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:48:52.032 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2021, the value provided for "Highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) patients on treatment and in active employment" is 15.16. This value corresponds to the year 2020, not 2021. For the year 2021, the value provided is 98.326.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) patients on treatment and in active employment N in the year 2021?" is 98.326, not 15.16.

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '70.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the % of total procurement (Average of SA region) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:03.554 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2021, we can see that the % of total procurement for the SA region is provided as 69 and 71 for the SA operations - PGM and SA operations - Gold respectively. However, there is no specific value provided for the SA region as a whole in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the % of total procurement for the SA region in 2021 from the given table.

Are you sure that '22.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Restructuring costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:17.347 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the restructuring costs are indicated as (107) for SA rand. There is no specific mention of restructuring costs for the US dollar in 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the restructuring costs per income statement in the year 2021 for the US dollar.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:28.652 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table regarding Cardiorespiratory TB (CRTB), the TB rate per 1,000 employees in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020 and 2022. Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the TB rate per 1,000 employees in 2021.

For the second table, the TB rate per 1,000 employees in the year 2021 is indeed provided as 5.05. This value is explicitly stated in the table for the year 2021.

For the third table, the TB rate per 1,000 employees in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2022 and 2021. Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the TB rate per 1,000 employees in 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the TB rate per 1,000 employees in the year 2021?" based on the information provided in the tables is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '12.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:33.443 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

In the row corresponding to the year 2021, we have the following information:
- 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated): 12.5
- 2021 Emissions in tonnes: 190.0

To calculate the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021, we need to divide the total emissions in tonnes by the emissions per unit ore milled:
Tonnes of CO2 per unit ore milled = 190.0 / 12.5 = 15.2

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled in the year 2021?" is 15.2.

For the second table:

The information provided does not contain the necessary data to calculate the Tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per unit ore milled for the year 2021 in the EU region. The values for 2021 Emissions (in gram per tonne milled/ treated) and 2021 Emissions in tonnes are marked as N/A, indicating that the data is not available.

Conclusion: Yes

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:39.029 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Current tax and royalties in the year 2021.

Table 1:
- For the year 2021:
  - Tax and royalties payable: 10 million
  - Deferred tax liabilities: Not provided for 2021

Table 2:
- For the year 2021:
  - Profit before royalties, carbon tax, and tax: Not provided for 2021
  - Royalties: Not provided for 2021

Table 3:
- For the year 2021:
  - Deferred revenue: 156 million
  - Tax and royalties payable: 189 million

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Current tax and royalties in the year 2021 are as follows:
- Table 1: Tax and royalties payable = 10 million
- Table 2: Not provided
- Table 3: Tax and royalties payable = 189 million

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Current tax and royalties in the year 2021?" is 10 million, not 22.0.

Are you sure that '3139.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total water withdrawn in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:48.053 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total water withdrawn value is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the years 2020 and 2019. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the Total water withdrawn value for the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Total water withdrawn value is explicitly provided as 124.6 '000ML'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total water withdrawn in the year 2021?" based on the second table is 124.6 '000ML'.

Therefore, '3139.0' is not the correct answer to the question based on the information provided in the tables.

Are you sure that '1073000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Water used in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:49:54.292 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine if the water used in the year 2021 is explicitly stated:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Total water withdrawn is provided, but the unit of measurement is '000 ML, which indicates thousand megaliters. The value given is not 1073000.0, but rather it is in '000 ML.
   - Conclusion for Table 1: The water used in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 1073000.0.

2. **Table 2:**
   - Total water withdrawn is provided in '000 ML, but the specific value for the year 2021 is not mentioned. The value is not 1073000.0.
   - Conclusion for Table 2: The water used in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 1073000.0.

3. **Table 3:**
   - The table does not provide specific information about the year 2021. It gives values for different units and locations but does not mention the total water withdrawn for the year 2021.
   - Conclusion for Table 3: The water used in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 1073000.0.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided tables, the water used in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 1073000.0 in any of the tables.

**Conclusion: No**

Are you sure that '352.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total socioeconomic development (SED) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '40.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:50:24.974 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the carbon tax expense in the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Carbon tax expense for 2021: R4m/US$0.3m

2. Table 2:
   - Carbon tax expense for 2021: R4m/US$0.3m

3. Table 3:
   - Carbon tax expense for 2021: Not explicitly stated

Based on the information provided in the tables, the carbon tax expense for the year 2021 is consistently R4m/US$0.3m in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 does not provide the specific carbon tax expense for 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the carbon tax expense in the year 2021?" based on the information in the tables is 'yes'.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '41.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:02.096 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that there is no specific information provided for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. The table only includes data for Group and Sulphur dioxides (SO2) emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information given in the tables, we cannot determine the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the year 2021.

The value '68.606' corresponds to the Adjusted EBITDA for the year 2021, not the ALL Administration expenses. Therefore, we cannot determine the ALL Administration expenses per the income statement for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '7.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:08.319 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the year 2021, the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) is not explicitly provided in the tables given. The tables only mention the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and the Medically Treated Injury Frequency Rate (MTIFR) for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information available in the tables, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '60.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:12.969 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first markdown table:

|                                |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |
|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Environmental stewardship (6%) |  21.75 |     60 |   17.5 |
| Total                          | 388    |    400 |  400   |

For the year 2021, the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues is not explicitly provided in the table. The value of '60' corresponds to the year 2021, but it is associated with "Environmental stewardship (6%)" and not specifically with assets under management.

Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot definitively state that '60.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

2024-03-07 21:51:27.744 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 shows the following information:

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:35.858 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows the total land area protected and the breakdown by region, but it does not specify the area of forestland with protected conservation status for the year 2021.

For the second table:

Similarly, the area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table focuses on key resources and relationships needed for value creation, specifically mentioning the land under management in different regions, but it does not mention the area of forestland with protected conservation status for the year 2021.

For the third table:

The area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table discusses data integrity, closure liability reduction, and establishing baselines for measurement, but it does not mention the area of forestland with protected conservation status for the year 2021.

Conclusion: No, based on the information provided in the tables, '0.0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '18.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:42.080 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the average hours of training for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Core skills training: Total training hours = 25,923,072
   - Cadet training: Total training hours = 67,072
   - Since there is no specific mention of the year 2021 in Table 1, we cannot determine the average hours of training for that year. Therefore, we cannot conclude the value for the year 2021 in Table 1.

2. Table 2:
   - Cadet training: Total training hours = 67,072
   - Coaches/mentorship training: Total training hours = 4
   - Similar to Table 1, there is no explicit mention of the year 2021 in Table 2. Hence, we cannot determine the average hours of training for that year in Table 2.

3. Table 3:
   - Leadership development: Total training hours = 764,000
   - Core skills training: Total training hours = 25,923,072
   - In Table 3, there is no specific information provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot conclude the average hours of training for the year 2021 in Table 3.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, the average hours of training for the year 2021 cannot be determined from the given information. 

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" is **no**.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '7.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:51:57.261 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only shows the points for 2021 and 2022, which are 7 and 6 respectively. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is explicitly stated as 7. However, it is important to note that the points for 2021 are also provided as 7, which aligns with the stated B-BBEE Scorecard Level. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." based on this table is '7'.

In the third table, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only shows the points for 2021 and 2022, which are 8 and 7 respectively. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question based on the provided tables is '7'.

2024-03-07 21:52:01.840 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific information provided for Black female executive directors in the year 2021. The table only mentions the percentage of female directors, which is 31%. Therefore, based on the information given in the first table, we cannot determine the percentage of Black female executive directors in the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, it mentions the gender diversity of the board but does not specify the percentage of Black female executive directors. The information provided in the second table also does not help us determine the percentage of Black female executive directors in the year 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no mention of Black female executive directors specifically. The table talks about maintaining a balance between male and female board members and promoting gender diversity, but it does not provide the exact percentage of Black female executive directors.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot determine the percentage of Black female executive directors in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:06.313 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row corresponding to the year in question does not provide a specific value for the average age of directors younger than 50. It only mentions the retirement age and the possibility of extension. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact age of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the row corresponding to the year in question also does not provide a specific value for the average age of directors younger than 50. It mentions the promotion of directors from different races and cultures but does not give a numerical value for the age.

In the third table, the row corresponding to the year in question does mention the approved retirement age for directors and the possibility of extension, but it does not provide a specific value for the average age of directors younger than 50.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact age of directors younger than 50 in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '63.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the between 50 and 60 + older than 60 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:10.436 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at each table individually:

1. In the first table, there is no specific mention of the age range between 50 and 60 or older than 60 for the year 2021. The only age mentioned is the retirement age of 72 years.

2. In the second table, there is a mention of promoting the appointment of directors from different races and cultures, but no specific age range information is provided for the year 2021.

3. In the third table, there is a mention of the retirement age being extendable to 63 years, but this does not directly answer the question about the age range between 50 and 60 or older than 60 for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '18.976' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:13.515 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the Contractor costs for that year are provided as follows:

- 2021 - Contractors: 18.976

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Contractor costs per income statement in the year 2021?" is '18.976'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '68.606' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:18.347 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the income statement extract for the year 2021 shows the value of Adjusted EBITDA as 68.606 R million. This represents the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for that year. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 68.606 R million.

Are you sure that '0.033' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-07 21:52:30.886 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of the value '0.033' in the row corresponding to the year 2021. The table mainly discusses investments in safety training and technologies, but does not provide the exact value mentioned in the question.

Moving on to the second table, the row related to the year 2021 under 'HUMAN CAPITAL' mentions improvements in safety indicators with the lowest fatal injury frequency rate in the Group's history of 0.033 per million hours worked. Therefore, the value '0.033' is indeed provided in this table for the year 2021.

Lastly, in the third table, there is no mention of the value '0.033' in the row corresponding to the year 2021. The focus is on safe production in line with ICMM requirements and increased trust or perception with improved safety results.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021?" is **yes**.
