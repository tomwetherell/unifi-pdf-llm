Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:35.623 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '4', but it is not specified whether this corresponds to the B-BBEE level for that year. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively state that the B-BBEE level in 2021 was '4.0'.

Moving on to the second table, the B-BBEE level information is not present, so we cannot determine the B-BBEE level for 2021 from this table either.

In the third table, there is no information related to the B-BBEE level, so we cannot ascertain the B-BBEE level for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot confidently say that the B-BBEE level in the year 2021 was '4.0'.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:29:50.865 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) reported for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - No specific value is provided for the LTIFR in 2021. The only value mentioned is for the total number of recordable injuries, which is 3433255. Therefore, we cannot determine the LTIFR for 2021 from this table.

2. **Table 2:**
   - The LTIFR reported in 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this table. The only information provided is the number of reported occupational diseases for South Africa, which is 2261. Hence, we cannot find the LTIFR for 2021 from this table.

3. **Table 3:**
   - In this table, the LTIFR for 2021 is not directly given. The data provided includes the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and the total number of recordable injuries, which are 313155 and 201183274, respectively. However, the LTIFR for 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) reported for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:30:11.235 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities - calculated is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs (medical treatment cases), LTIs and Fatalities - reported is 201183274, but the calculated value is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities - calculated is 3433255. However, this value corresponds to the calculated total for the year 2020, not 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '3433255.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities – calculated in the year 2021?"

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:30:19.747 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are women is stated as 25.0%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Percentage of board members who are women in the year 2021?" is '25.0%'.

In the second table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are women is also stated as 25.0%. Therefore, the correct answer remains '25.0%'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '1429.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) – all sources in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:30:59.437 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table for the year 2021, the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) - all sources is given as 1429. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) – all sources in the year 2021?" is indeed 1429.

In the second table, the value for 2021 is not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) - all sources for that year from this table.

In the third table, the value for 2021 is also not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) - all sources for that year from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, the correct answer is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:31:10.522 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - Total value of Agri+Gator Programme in 2021: 61.7
   - In-kind and technical support in 2021: 1.1

2. **Table 2**:
   - Equity investments in 2021: 21.4
   - Total value of Agri+Gator Programme in 2021: 61.7

3. **Table 3**:
   - Total value of E+Scalator Programme in 2021: 55.2
   - In-kind and technical support in 2021: 28.7

To find the total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in 2021, we need to sum the corresponding values from Table 1 and Table 3:
- Total value of Agri+Gator Programme in 2021: 61.7
- Total value of E+Scalator Programme in 2021: 55.2

Therefore, the total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in 2021 is 61.7 + 55.2 = 116.9, not 117.0.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:31:21.416 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Total number of employees in the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - There is no information provided about the total number of employees for the year 2021.
   
2. In the second table:
   - There is no information provided about the total number of employees for the year 2021.

3. In the third table:
   - There is no information provided about the total number of employees for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information given in the tables, we cannot determine the Total number of employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:31:54.226 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of lost days (Distell Group) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '161127550' corresponds to the year 2020, not 2021.

Looking at the second table, the Number of lost days (Distell Group) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as '312655', not '161127550'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of lost days (Distell Group) in the year 2021?" is '312655', not '161127550'.

Are you sure that '69478.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:32:05.501 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2 are 134371 tonnes CO2e. There is no specific mention of CO emissions in this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2 are 134371 tonnes CO2e. Again, there is no specific mention of CO emissions in this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the carbon emissions for Scope 1 are 69478 tonnes CO2e. This table does not provide information on CO emissions.

Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the CO emissions specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, the value '69478.0' cannot be confirmed as the correct answer to the question regarding CO emissions in 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:32:24.303 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for 2021 does not have a specific value provided for the "Rand value of CSI/SED spend in environmental management projects". Therefore, we cannot confirm that the amount for 2021 is exactly 2,220,000.

Moving on to the second table, the row for 2021 does have a specific value provided for "Rand value of investments in projects to improve waste efficiency", which is 6,148,048. This means that the value of 2,220,000 is not the correct answer for the amount of assets under management in 2021.

In the third table, the row for 2021 does not have a specific value provided for "Rand value of investments in projects to improve water efficiency". Therefore, we cannot confirm that the amount for 2021 is exactly 737,625.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer cannot be confirmed to be 2,220,000 for the amount of assets under management in 2021.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '2680770.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed screening in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:32:48.188 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 in the row "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" is '0', which does not represent the Area of forestland owned.

Looking at the second table, the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 in the row "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" is '0', which again does not represent the Area of forestland owned.

Looking at the third table, the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. There is no mention of forestland ownership in this table for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021 is not available.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:32:54.808 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, there is no specific row that provides information on the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated. The values provided in the table are related to emissions and biomass, not forestland restoration. Therefore, based on the information in the first table for the year 2021, it is not possible to determine the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, again, there is no specific row that provides information on the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated. The values in this table are related to biogas and biomass, not forestland restoration. Therefore, based on the information in the second table for the year 2021, it is also not possible to determine the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated.

Moving on to the third table, which provides information on waste disposal and recycling percentages, there is no mention of forestland restoration. The values in this table are related to waste management, not forestland restoration. Therefore, based on the information in the third table for the year 2021, it is not possible to determine the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the three tables, it is not possible to determine the area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021?" is 'No'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:32:59.087 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" shows a value of 0 for that year. However, this row does not provide information about the Area of forestland with protected conservation status. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no relevant information provided that directly relates to the Area of forestland with protected conservation status. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively state that the Area of forestland with protected conservation status in the year 2021 is '0.0'.

Are you sure that '25.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:33:12.256 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row that mentions "Spend with black-owned businesses as a % of total procurement spend (%)" shows a value of 25.4. This value represents the percentage of procurement spend with black-owned businesses in 2021. However, this value does not specifically indicate the procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot definitively state that "25.4" is the correct answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.

Are you sure that '12.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:33:21.324 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1:**
   - Number of board members who are women in 2021: 3
   - Percentage of board members who are women in 2021: 25.0%

2. **Table 2:**
   - Number of board members in 2021: 12
   - Number of board members who are deemed non-executive in 2021: 10

3. **Table 3:**
   - Average age of directors in 2021: 59
   - Overall board and committee meeting attendance in 2021: 95.8%

Based on the information provided in the tables, there is no explicit mention of the number of board members over 50 in the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine if '12.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the board members over 50 in 2021.

**Conclusion: No**

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:33:38.813 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 1 (for 2021)
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Namibia only): * (not specified for 2021)

2. In the second table:
   - Number of reported occupational diseases (Distell Group): Not provided for 2021
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 1 (for 2021)

3. In the third table:
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Distell Group): Not provided for 2021
   - Number of lost days (Distell Group): Not provided for 2021

Based on the information provided in the tables, the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned as '1.0' in any of the tables. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.
