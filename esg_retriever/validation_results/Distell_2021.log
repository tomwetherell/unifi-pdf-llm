Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:37.235 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is provided as '4'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is '4'.

For the second table:

The B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE level for the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:

The B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is not provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot determine the B-BBEE level for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: 
Based on the information provided in the tables, the B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is '4' according to the first table. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

The values are given for 2022 and 2020, but not for 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is 95.8% for 2021 based on this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Overall board and committee meeting attendance for the year 2021 is indeed provided as 95.8%. So, based on this table, the correct answer to the question "What was the Overall board and committee meeting attendance in the year 2021?" is '95.8'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:55.524 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. In the first table:
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 0 1 0
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Namibia only): *

   There is no specific value provided for the Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group) in 2021 in this table.

2. In the second table:
   - Number of reported occupational diseases (Distell Group): 261
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 0 1 0

   The value for the Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group) in 2021 is not explicitly stated in this table.

3. In the third table:
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Namibia only): 0 * *
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Angola and Kenya only): 0 * *

   There is no specific value provided for the Number of work-related fatalities (Namibia only) in 2021 in this table.

Based on the analysis of the three tables, none of them explicitly state the Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group) in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group) in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:56:58.684 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of board members who are women is stated as 3. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of board members who are women in the year 2021?" is '3', not '3.0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no explicit mention of the Number of board members who are women. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for this year from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Number of board members who are women is again stated as 3. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of board members who are women in the year 2021?" is '3', not '3.0'.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is '3', not '3.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:57:17.868 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are women is stated as 25.0%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Percentage of board members who are women in the year 2021?" is '25.0%'. 

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are women is also stated as 25.0%. 

In the third table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' is stated as 25.0%, not the percentage of women on the board.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is '25.0%', and it is consistent across all three tables for the year 2021.

Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is 261374.0 for 2021 in this table.

In the second table, the Total indirect energy consumption for the year 2021 is 261374 GJ. However, this table specifically refers to indirect energy consumption, not total direct and indirect energy consumption. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is 261374.0 for 2021 in this table.

In the third table, the Total indirect energy consumption for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value is 261374.0 for 2021 in this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:57:48.295 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **E+Scalator Programme**:
   - Total value in 2021: 55.2

2. **Agri+Gator Programme**:
   - Total value in 2021: 61.7

3. **Equity investments**:
   - No value provided for 2021

Therefore, the Total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in the year 2021 would be:
55.2 (E+Scalator Programme) + 61.7 (Agri+Gator Programme) = 116.9

So, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in the year 2021?" is 116.9, not 117.9.

Are you sure that '2196737.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:57:52.680 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

The Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '2196737' in the table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021?" is '2196737'.

For the second markdown table:

The Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. However, the baseline year for water reduction targets is provided as '2014'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the exact Total volume of water consumed in the year 2021.

For the third markdown table:

The Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table.

Conclusion: 
For the first markdown table, the correct answer is 'yes'.
For the second and third markdown tables, the correct answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '13600.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total number of employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:04.938 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table:

| LABOUR                                                                                                         | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Employee turnover (i.e., number of persons who departed relative to the total number of employees at year end) | 9,1%    | 21,1%   | 8,8%    |
| Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated                                                         | 8406816 | 8098560 | 8837280 |

From the table, we can see that the total number of employees is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of employees in 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No

Next, let's analyze the second table:

| ECONOMIC                                                                         | 2022           | 2021           | 2020           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Rand value of net profit after tax per employee                                  | R470 770       | R515 441       | R91 900        |
| Rand value of total compensation paid to employees, including wages and benefits | R2 587 339 000 | R2 879 251 000 | R2 630 684 000 |

Similarly, the total number of employees is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table as well. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of employees in 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No

Lastly, let's analyze the third table:

| ECONOMIC                                           | 2022           | 2021           | 2020         |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Rand value of total revenue generated per employee | R7 405 848     | R6 363 636     | R4 617 177   |
| Rand value of net profit after tax generated       | R1 890 140 970 | R2 002 489 000 | R394 620 000 |

Once again, the total number of employees is not explicitly provided for the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of employees in 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the total number of employees in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:15.239 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 for the year 2021 is 134371. This matches the value provided in the table.

Looking at the second table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the value for this year from this table.

Looking at the third table, the Total carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) - Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for the year 2021 is 431280. This value is not specifically for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, so we cannot determine the exact value for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can only confirm that the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 for the year 2021 is 134371 from the first table. For the other tables, the specific value for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021 is not explicitly stated.

For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

Are you sure that '667.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:39.634 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage for the year 2021 from the information given in the table.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '63656.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:47.490 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of CO emissions for the year 2021. The value provided for that year is for Stationary combustion. Therefore, we cannot determine the CO emissions for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, there is no mention of CO emissions specifically for the year 2021. The value provided for that year is for Total Scope 1 emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the CO emissions for 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, there is no mention of CO emissions specifically for the year 2021. The value provided for that year is for Total emissions. Therefore, we cannot determine the CO emissions for 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the CO emissions for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:50.837 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific mention of NOx emissions for the year 2021. The value provided for the year 2021 is for Stationary combustion, not NOx emissions.

Moving on to the second table, there is no mention of NOx emissions for the year 2021 in the row related to Generation and consumption of electricity, heat or steam. The total Scope 1 emissions are provided for the year 2021, but this does not specify the NOx emissions.

In the third table, there is no mention of NOx emissions for the year 2021 in the row related to Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips). The total emissions are provided for the year 2021, but again, this does not specify the NOx emissions.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:58:57.358 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for "Stationary combustion" in the year 2021 shows a value of 63656. This value does not correspond to Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) specifically. Therefore, the value 63656.0 is not the correct answer to the question regarding the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, the row for "Total Scope 1 emissions" in the year 2021 shows a value of 69478. This value also does not correspond to Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) specifically.

Finally, in the third table, the row for "Total emissions" in the year 2021 shows a value of 432280. This value also does not correspond to Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) specifically.

Therefore, based on the provided tables, there is no explicit information regarding the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:00.950 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is not provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the emissions of VOCs for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table, the row for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is also not provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the emissions of VOCs for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table, the row for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. However, it is mentioned that the value is '0' for the other years. Since there is no specific value given for 2021, we cannot definitively say that the emissions of VOCs in 2021 were '0'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot conclusively determine that the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021 were '0.0'.

Are you sure that '1.31' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:05.896 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Distell Group) for 2021: Not provided.
   - Number of lost days (Distell Group) for 2021: Not provided.

2. **Table 2**:
   - Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and Fatalities for 2021: Not provided.
   - Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for 2021: 1.13 (from the values provided for 2022, 2021, and 2020).

3. **Table 3**:
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Angola and Kenya only) for 2021: Not provided.
   - Number of lost days (Angola and Kenya only) for 2021: Not provided.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in any of the tables. Therefore, we cannot confirm that 1.31 is the correct answer for the question regarding the All Injury Frequency Rate in 2021.

**Conclusion**: No.

Are you sure that '99314869.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:12.758 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

In the row for the year 2021, the Rand value of corporate social investment (CSI) / socioeconomic development (SED) expenditures is reported as R99 314 869. There is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in the row for CSI/SED spend as a percentage of total revenue generated. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '99314869.0'.

For the second markdown table:

In the row for the year 2021, the Rand value of corporate social investment (CSI) / socioeconomic development (SED) expenditures is reported as R99 314 869. There is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in the row for CSI/SED EXPENDITURE. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '99314869.0'.

For the third markdown table:

The table does not contain any information related to the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No, the value '99314869.0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021 based on the provided markdown tables.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:20.379 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" does not have a value specified for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the row for "Rand value of carbon tax paid" does not provide information about the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021. 

In the third table, the row for "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" does have a value of 0 for the year 2021. However, this value corresponds to biomass (wood chips) and not the Area of forestland owned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:24.703 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for the year 2021 are present for other rows, but not for the specific row related to the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

For the second table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for the year 2021 are present for other rows, but not for the specific row related to the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

For the third table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values for the year 2021 are present for other rows, but not for the specific row related to the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:31.514 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of '95.8%' is for the Overall board and committee meeting attendance in 2021, not specifically for the Audit committee.

Moving on to the second table, the Length of current auditor's service is provided for each year but does not give information about the Audit committee meeting attendance rate.

In the third table, the Auditor remuneration: % of non-audit fees is provided for each year, but again, there is no specific mention of the Audit committee meeting attendance rate.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '192.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:36.535 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the first table:

| LABOUR                                                 | 2022        | 2021        | 2020        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated | 8406816     | 8098560     | 8837280     |
| Rand value of employee training spend                  | R26 100 000 | R24 500 000 | R24 600 000 |

For the year 2021, the table provides the following information:
- Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated: 8098560
- Rand value of employee training spend: R24 500 000

To calculate the average hours of training in the year 2021, we need to divide the training spend by the total number of person hours worked:
Average hours of training in 2021 = Rand value of employee training spend / Total number of person hours worked
Average hours of training in 2021 = R24 500 000 / 8098560 ≈ 3.02 hours

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" is approximately 3.02 hours, not 192.0.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '25.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:41.554 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to "Spend with black-owned businesses as a % of total procurement spend (%)" shows a value of 25.4. This value does not specifically mention Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), or Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively state that "25.4" represents the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:44.747 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the LABOUR table for the year 2021, the row "Spend with black-owned businesses as a % of total procurement spend (%)" shows a value of 25.4. This value represents the percentage of total procurement spend that was spent with black-owned businesses in 2021.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is '25.4'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Are you sure that '10.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 22:59:52.761 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021:

|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|

| Average age of directors (in years)                        |   60.2 |   59   |   58   |

There is no specific information provided about the number of board members over the age of 50 in the year 2021. The table only mentions the average age of directors, which is 59 for 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of board members over 50 in 2021 based on this table.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '1935840000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:00.629 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to "CSI/SED spend as a percentage of net profit after tax (NPAT)" shows a value of 5.0%. This does not provide information directly related to the "Cost relating to acquisition per income statement" for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021?" is **no**.
