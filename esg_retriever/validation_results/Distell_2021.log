The table includes indicators for total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) for Scope 1 and 2, as well as carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2e) for Scope 3.

The table does not provide a separate breakdown for Scope 1 emissions specifically for the year 2021. It only shows the total carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2, and the emissions for Scope 3 for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Since there is no specific value given for Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 1 in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 17:59:50.687 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 3 in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific value related to Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 in the provided markdown table. The table includes GHG emissions intensity for Scope 3 emissions expressed as metric tonnes of CO2e per million rands in revenue for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

The table provides the GHG emissions intensity for Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021, which is 15264 metric tonnes of CO2e per million rands in revenue. However, this value represents the emissions intensity and not the total carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2 e) for Scope 3 in the year 2021.

Since the table does not directly provide the total carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2 e) for Scope 3 in the year 2021, the answer to the specific question "What was the Carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 3 in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators for "Number of work-related fatalities (Namibia only)" and "Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Angola and Kenya only)."

The table specifies that the number of work-related fatalities for Namibia is 0 for all the years mentioned (2022, 2021, 2020). However, it does not provide specific information about work-related fatalities for the Distell Group as a whole or for other locations outside Namibia.

Since the table only mentions work-related fatalities for Namibia and not for the Distell Group in general, we cannot directly retrieve the number of work-related fatalities for the Distell Group in the year 2021 from the context.

Are you sure that '2261.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:00:59.116 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the values for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, with the value of 2261 given for 2020. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of reported occupational diseases for 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) is explicitly stated for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. The value for 2021 is not provided in the table, so we cannot determine the exact number of reported occupational diseases for 2021 from this table either.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that '2261.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) in the year 2021?".

The table includes an indicator "Spend with black women-owned businesses as a % of total procurement spend (%)," which specifies the percentage of spend with black women-owned businesses.

However, this specific indicator only provides information about the spend with black women-owned businesses, not black-owned businesses in general. It is important to note that black women-owned businesses are a subset of black-owned businesses. Without a separate indicator for the spend with black-owned businesses as a whole, we cannot determine the exact percentage of total procurement spend that went to black-owned businesses in 2021.

Given that the table provides the percentage of revenue generated in South Africa for each year and the Rand value of total revenue generated per employee, we can calculate the total revenue generated in South Africa for 2021 by using the percentage provided and the Rand value per employee. 

By multiplying the percentage of revenue generated in South Africa (72.7%) by the Rand value of total revenue generated per employee (R6 363 636), we can calculate the approximate Rand value of total revenue generated in South Africa in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Rand value of total revenue generated in South Africa in the year 2021?" can be directly calculated from the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

The table includes indicators such as "Rand value of net profit after tax per employee" and "Rand value of total compensation paid to employees, including wages and benefits."

While the "Rand value of total compensation paid to employees, including wages and benefits" gives us the total compensation paid to employees, it does not explicitly break down the training expenses separately. Training expenses are typically categorized separately from total compensation.

Without a specific indicator for training expenses or a breakdown of expenses that includes training spend, we cannot determine the exact Rand value of employee training spend in 2021 from the provided table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:03:29.022 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total volume of electricity self-generated in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to self-generated electricity in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total volume of electricity Consumed (MWh) - purchased + self-generated" and "Total indirect energy consumption."

The indicator "Total volume of electricity Consumed (MWh) - purchased + self-generated" provides the total volume of electricity consumed, including both purchased and self-generated electricity. However, this indicator does not separate the self-generated electricity from the purchased electricity. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the total volume of electricity self-generated in the year 2021 from this table.

Since the table does not explicitly provide the specific value for the total volume of electricity self-generated in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Total volume of electricity self-generated (MWh) – all sources in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:04:10.603 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of person hours worked (PHW) calculated in the year 2021, we need to have information related to the number of full-time employees (FTE) and the total hours worked by each employee in that year. The provided markdown table includes data on the number of full-time employees (FTE) for each year and the kilowatt hours of electricity consumed for each year.

The table does not directly provide the total number of person hours worked (PHW) for the year 2021. The number of full-time employees (FTE) alone does not give us the total number of person hours worked without additional information on the average hours worked per employee or the total hours worked by all employees in that year.

Since the table does not contain the necessary data to calculate the total number of person hours worked (PHW) in 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Total number of person hours worked (PHW) – calculated in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:04:25.514 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total volume of electricity consumed (MWh) in the year 2021, we need to consider both the electricity purchased and self-generated. The table provides the following relevant information for the year 2021:

1. Total volume of electricity (indirect energy) purchased: 72,604 MWh
2. Electricity self-generated - biogas/methane: 1,402,664 kWh

To calculate the total volume of electricity consumed (MWh) in 2021, we need to convert the self-generated electricity from kWh to MWh. Since 1 MWh is equal to 1,000 kWh, the self-generated electricity in MWh is 1,402,664 kWh / 1,000 = 1,402.664 MWh.

Adding the purchased electricity (72,604 MWh) to the self-generated electricity (1,402.664 MWh) gives us the total volume of electricity consumed in MWh for the year 2021: 72,604 MWh + 1,402.664 MWh = 74,006.664 MWh.

Therefore, the total volume of electricity consumed (MWh) – purchased + self-generated in the year 2021 is 74,006.664 MWh.

2024-03-10 18:04:31.108 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total number of employees in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to the total number of employees in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators such as "Employee turnover" and "Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated."

The "Employee turnover" indicator provides information on the percentage of employees who departed relative to the total number of employees at year end, but it does not give the total number of employees directly. The "Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated" indicator provides information on the total number of person hours worked, which is not directly related to the total number of employees.

Since there is no specific indicator in the table that directly states the total number of employees in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Total number of employees in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:04:49.499 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to find the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021.

### Table 1:
- For 2021: R600 000

### Table 2:
- For 2021: Not explicitly stated

### Table 3:
- For 2021: Not explicitly stated

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as R600 000 only in Table 1.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 'yes'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:05:26.214 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of board members who are deemed executive in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to executive board members in the provided markdown table. The table includes the indicators "Number of board members" and "Number of board members who are deemed non-executive."

Since the table explicitly provides the number of board members who are deemed non-executive for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we can infer that the remaining board members (those not classified as non-executive) are executive board members. Therefore, by subtracting the number of non-executive board members from the total number of board members, we can determine the number of board members who are deemed executive.

In this case, the number of board members who are deemed executive in the year 2021 can be directly found in the table by subtracting the number of non-executive board members from the total number of board members for 2021.

Answer:

The table includes the number of board members and the number of board members who are deemed non-executive.

The table does not explicitly provide the number of board members who are deemed 'independent' in 2021. While the number of non-executive board members may include independent board members, it is not explicitly stated that all non-executive board members are independent.

Without a specific breakdown of the board members' independence status, we cannot determine the exact number of board members who are deemed 'independent' in 2021 from the information provided in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators for the average length of executive director service and the average length of non-executive director service, but it does not explicitly mention the average length of director (full board) service.

Since the table does not provide a direct indicator for the average length of director (full board) service, we cannot determine the specific average length of service for full board directors in the year 2021 from the given information.

From the table, we can directly retrieve the values for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021, which are 134,371 tonnes CO2e, and the Scope 3 emissions in 2021, which are 296,909 tonnes CO2e. By adding these two values together, we can calculate the total carbon emissions for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:06:16.463 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this total in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators for "Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 2" and "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2."

The indicator "Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2" provides the total carbon emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 combined. However, it does not include Scope 3 emissions. Since the question specifically asks for the total carbon emissions for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in 2021, we cannot directly retrieve this information from the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) – Scopes 1, 2 and 3 in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The answer to the specific question "What was the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table. 

In the table, it is explicitly stated that in the year 2021, there were 12 board members in total, out of which 10 were deemed non-executive. To calculate the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in 2021, we can use the formula:

Percentage of non-executive board members = (Number of non-executive board members / Total number of board members) * 100

Substituting the values from the table:
Percentage of non-executive board members in 2021 = (10 / 12) * 100 = 83.33%

Therefore, the answer to the question is directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:07:02.037 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO specifically in the year 2021, we need to look for a value related to CO emissions in the year 2021 in the provided markdown table. The table includes data on Scope 1 direct emissions, with a breakdown of emissions from different sources over the years.

In the table, there is a specific value under "Stationary combustion" for each year, including 2021. However, the table does not specify the emissions of CO specifically. The values provided under "Stationary combustion" represent emissions from that source in general, not specifically CO emissions.

Since the table does not provide a direct value for CO emissions in the year 2021, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO for that year based on the information given.

However, the table only includes data for Scope 1 direct emissions, specifically for stationary combustion.

The table does not provide a specific value for particulate matter (PM10) emissions in 2021. It only shows data related to stationary combustion emissions for different years. Without a direct mention of PM10 emissions or a breakdown of emissions by pollutant type, we cannot determine the air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) for the year 2021 from this table.

However, the provided markdown table only includes the number of injuries resulting in lost time and the number of lost days for the Distell Group in 2021.

The All Injury Frequency Rate is calculated by dividing the total number of injuries by the total number of hours worked, usually expressed per million hours worked. In this case, we have the number of injuries but not the total number of hours worked, which is necessary to calculate the All Injury Frequency Rate.

Since the table does not provide the required information (number of hours worked) to calculate the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:07:56.327 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes information on the Total Number of recordable injuries and the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR).

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) is the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) per 200,000 person hours worked. This rate is not directly the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) as specified in the question. The LTIFR specifically focuses on LTIs and uses a different denominator (person hours worked) compared to the All Injury Frequency Rate.

Since the table does not provide the exact indicator for the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, the answer to the specific question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:07:58.994 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, the specific question is asking for the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021. However, the table only includes information about the number of injuries resulting in lost time and the number of lost days in Angola and Kenya for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020.

The All Injury Frequency Rate is typically calculated by dividing the total number of injuries by the total number of hours worked and then multiplying by 1,000,000 to standardize the rate per 1 million hours worked. The table does not provide the total number of hours worked, which is essential for calculating the All Injury Frequency Rate.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:09:53.137 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes an indicator labeled "Overall board and committee meeting attendance," which provides the attendance rate for both board and committee meetings.

Since the indicator mentioned in the table combines the attendance rates for both board and committee meetings, it does not specifically isolate the attendance rate for the Audit committee meetings alone. Without a separate breakdown of attendance rates specifically for the Audit committee meetings, we cannot determine the attendance rate for the Audit committee in the year 2021 from the given table.

The table only includes information on the B-BBEE level and the spend with black-owned businesses as a percentage of total procurement spend.

While the percentage of spend with black-owned businesses is provided, it does not break down the spend based on the categories of Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned. Without this breakdown, we cannot directly retrieve the specific BBBEE procurement spend from these categories in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:11:13.261 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the percentage of black board members in the year 2021 from the provided markdown table, we need to look for a specific indicator that directly states the percentage of black board members. In the table, there is no direct indicator that specifies the percentage of black board members.

The table includes information on the percentage of board members deemed 'independent' and the number of board members deemed historically-disadvantaged South Africans ('HDSA'). While the term 'historically-disadvantaged South Africans' may include black individuals, it is not explicitly stated in the context that all HDSA board members are black.

Without a specific breakdown of the racial composition of the HDSA board members or a separate indicator for the percentage of black board members, we cannot directly determine the percentage of black board members in the year 2021 from the provided table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage of black board members in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes the number of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' and the percentage of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' for each year.

In this case, historically-disadvantaged South Africans ('HDSA') is a broader category that includes various groups, not just black individuals. Therefore, we cannot directly equate 'HDSA' to black board members without further information on the composition of this category.

Since the table does not provide a specific breakdown of the 'HDSA' category into subgroups like black board members, we cannot accurately determine the percentage of black board members in the year 2021 from the given context.

The table primarily focuses on "CSI/SED EXPENDITURE" and the "Rand value of corporate social investment (CSI) / socioeconomic development (SED) expenditures."

Since the table does not contain any information related to depreciation or an income statement, we cannot directly find the Depreciation amount as per the income statement in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Depreciation as per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.
