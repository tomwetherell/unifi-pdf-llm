The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) is calculated as the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) per 200,000 person hours worked. In the provided table, we have the total number of LTIs reported in the year 2021, which is 313,155. However, we do not have the total number of person hours worked in 2021 to calculate the LTIFR. Without the specific data on the total person hours worked, we cannot determine the LTIFR for the year 2021 from the given table.

Answer:

The table provides the Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for the year 2021, which is 313155. This value represents the total number of injuries on duty leading to at least one lost day in 2021. However, the specific number of LTIs for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. The table only gives the total number of LTIs for that year, not the exact number for 2021 alone.

Therefore, the exact answer to the question "What was the Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:01:41.487 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of 2261 is given for the year 2020. Therefore, based on the information in the table, we cannot determine the Number of reported occupational diseases for the year 2021.

Looking at the second table, the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 2261. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of reported occupational diseases (South Africa only) in the year 2021?" is '2261'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:02:05.335 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provides information on the percentage of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' and the number of board members who are women for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, it does not directly provide the percentage of board members who are women in the year 2021. The table only shows the number of board members who are women in 2021, which is 3. To calculate the percentage of board members who are women in 2021, we would need the total number of board members for that year, which is not provided in the table. Therefore, the exact percentage of board members who are women in 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Conclusion: No.

| Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) | 2258753 | 2196737 | 1696277 |

The total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 2196737 kilolitres. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Now, looking at the second table:

| ENERGY                                                                                                                 |    2022 |    2021 |    2020 |

| Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) | 2258753 | 2196737 | 1696277 |
| Baseline year for water reduction targets                                                                              |    2014 |    2014 |    2014 |

The total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is again explicitly stated as 2196737 kilolitres. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

So, '2196737.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question for both tables.

| Number of board members who are deemed non-executive |     10 |     10 |     10 |

Are you sure that '12.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

The table provides the number of board members who are deemed executive for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, it does not explicitly state the specific number of board members who are deemed executive in the year 2021. The table only gives a general number for each year without specifying the breakdown of executive and non-executive members within the board. Therefore, the exact number of board members who are deemed executive in the year 2021 is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:05:00.090 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provides information on total carbon emissions for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, the specific question asks for the total carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in the year 2021. The table only provides separate values for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021 and Scope 3 emissions in 2021 but does not directly provide the combined total for all three scopes in 2021. Therefore, the exact answer to the question is not directly available in the context.

Conclusion: No.

2024-03-09 18:05:16.357 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The table provides the number of board members who are deemed non-executive and the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, it does not explicitly state the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021. The table only shows that the percentage was 83.3% for all three years, but it does not provide the specific percentage for 2021. Therefore, the exact answer to the question is not directly retrievable from the context.

Conclusion: No.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:05:19.033 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No, the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021 cannot be directly found in the provided markdown table. The table only provides the number of board members who are deemed non-executive in 2021, which is 10 out of 12. To calculate the percentage, you would need to divide the number of non-executive board members by the total number of board members and then multiply by 100. Since the percentage value is not explicitly given in the table, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:05:21.345 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The table provides the number of board members deemed 'independent' for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, along with the corresponding percentage. However, the specific percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. While the number of independent board members in 2021 is given as 8, the total number of board members is not provided, making it impossible to calculate the exact percentage for that year.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021?" cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Conclusion: No.

Explanation:
The table provided only contains information about the number and percentage of board members who are women for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. It does not provide any information about the independence status of board members. Therefore, the percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021 cannot be found in this table.

Conclusion:
No.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:07:48.772 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the "Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021." However, the provided markdown table only includes information on the total volume of non-hazardous waste sent for recycling in the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. There is no specific mention of "Food Waste Recovered" in the table.

Since the table does not provide a breakdown of the types of waste within the total volume sent for recycling, including food waste, the exact volume of Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context. Therefore, the answer to the specific question is 'no.'

The specific question asks for the "Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021." However, the provided markdown table does not contain any information related to the volume of waste sent for recycling, specifically food waste recovered in the year 2021. The table only includes data on the percentage of non-hazardous waste sent for recycling and the total volume of hazardous waste disposed of in 2022 and 2020. Since there is no mention of food waste or the specific volume of waste sent for recycling in 2021, the answer to the question cannot be found in the given context.

The table only includes information on the Rand value of employee training spend and the total number of person days lost due to absenteeism for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The average hours of training would require additional data such as the number of employees trained, the duration of training sessions, or the total training hours provided in 2021. Since this specific information is not present in the table, the average hours of training in 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Conclusion: No.

Explanation:
The table provides the number of board members who are historically-disadvantaged South Africans ('HDSA') for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, along with the percentage of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' for each year. However, the specific percentage of black board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. The table only provides the percentage of board members who are deemed 'HDSA' in general, which includes various historically-disadvantaged groups, not just black individuals. Therefore, the exact percentage of black board members in the year 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:10:24.631 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking about the "Description of approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021." In the provided markdown table, the metrics listed are related to water management, responsible drinking, and marketing. The table mentions metrics such as the percentage of total advertising impressions made on individuals at or above the legal drinking age and the number of incidents of non-compliance with industry or regulatory labeling and/or marketing codes.

However, the table does not explicitly provide the description of the approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021. The metrics mentioned focus on advertising impressions and compliance with regulations, but they do not detail the specific approach used for informing customers about products and services.

Therefore, the answer to the specific question is not directly retrievable from the context provided in the markdown table.
