Are you sure that '4.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:48.974 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table regarding LABOUR, the B-BBEE level for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is given as '4' without the decimal point, so it is not clear if the correct answer is '4' or '4.0'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the B-BBEE level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is not definitively '4.0'.

For the second table regarding Metrics, the SASB code and response are provided, but there is no information about the B-BBEE level for the year 2021.

For the third table regarding LABOUR, the Interns' percentages for different ethnicities are all '0' for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question cannot be determined definitively as '4.0'. 

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:21:52.083 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Overall board and committee meeting attendance for 2021 is stated as 95.8%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Overall board and committee meeting attendance in the year 2021?" is '95.8'.

Looking at the second table, the Overall board and committee meeting attendance for 2021 is also stated as 95.8%. Therefore, the correct answer remains '95.8'.

In the third table, the Overall board and committee meeting attendance for 2021 is not explicitly provided. However, based on the consistency of the value across the other tables, we can infer that it is likely to be 95.8%.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Overall board and committee meeting attendance in the year 2021?" is '95.8'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:22:35.849 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the percentage of employees who are women in the year 2021 is indeed 35%. Therefore, '35.0' is the correct answer to the question for the first table.

Looking at the second table, the percentage of employees who are women in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '35.0' is the correct answer for the second table.

Looking at the third table, the percentage of employees who are women in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for 2021 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine if '35.0' is the correct answer for the third table.

Therefore, based on the information provided, '35.0' is the correct answer for the first table, but we cannot confirm if it is correct for the second and third tables.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:23:06.257 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Total value of Agri+Gator Programme (R'million) in 2021: 61.7
   - In-kind and technical support (R'million) in 2021: 1.1

2. Table 2:
   - Equity investments (R'million) in 2021: 21.4
   - Total value of Agri+Gator Programme (R'million) in 2021: 61.7

3. Table 3:
   - Total value of E+Scalator Programme (R'million) in 2021: 55.2
   - In-kind and technical support (R'million) in 2021: 28.7

To find the total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in 2021, we need to sum the corresponding values from Table 1 and Table 3:
   - Total value of Agri+Gator Programme in 2021: 61.7
   - Total value of E+Scalator Programme in 2021: 55.2
   - Total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in 2021: 61.7 + 55.2 = 116.9

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total value of E+Scalator Programme + Agri+Gator Programme in the year 2021?" is 116.9, not 117.0.

Are you sure that '2196737.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:23:10.981 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) for the year 2021 is 2196737 kilolitres. So, '2196737' is indeed the correct answer to the question for the first table.

Looking at the second table, the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) for the year 2021 is also 2196737 kilolitres. So, '2196737' is again the correct answer for the second table.

In both tables, the value for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 2196737 kilolitres. 

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:23:22.953 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021 is R600 000.

In the second table, the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.

In the third table, the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that the Rand value of CSI/SED spend on basic needs and social development, including nutrition and/or feeding programmes in the year 2021 is R600 000.

Are you sure that '833.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:23:52.157 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive is explicitly stated as 83.3%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021?" is '83.3%', not '833.0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive is also explicitly stated as 83.3%. 

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive is not explicitly stated for this year.

Therefore, the correct answer is '83.3%', and the answer to the question is 'no'.

Are you sure that '69478.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:24:45.571 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row for "Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1" shows a value of 69478. This value represents the carbon emissions for Scope 1 in the year 2021, not the Air emissions of CO. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of CO for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '131.27' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:00.033 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities - calculated: Not relevant to the question.
   - Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR): The value provided is '1.13', not '131.27'. This value does not match the given '131.27'.
   
2. Table 2:
   - Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR): The value provided is '1.13', not '131.27'. This value does not match the given '131.27'.
   - Number of reported occupational diseases: Not relevant to the question.

3. Table 3:
   - Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs): Not relevant to the question.
   - Total Number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and Fatalities - reported: Not relevant to the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '131.27'. 

Conclusion: No.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:08.192 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the table related to environmental management projects:

In the year 2021, the Rand value of CSI/SED spend in environmental management projects was R2 220 000. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues in the year 2021?" is **R2 220 000**.

For the table related to economic factors:

The Rand value of current assets - in South Africa for the year 2021 was R14 523 037 000. The question is not directly related to this value, so it is not relevant to the question asked.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:20.009 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that there is no specific value provided for the "Area of forestland leased." The table only includes values for emissions related to biomass and total emissions for each year. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Area of forestland leased in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Area of forestland owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:27.096 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, we can see that there is no specific value provided for the "Area of forestland owned" in that year. The values provided in the table are related to emissions and biomass, not the area of forestland owned. Therefore, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we can see that the value provided is '0' for "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)" and '1123' for "Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biogas". Again, there is no specific value provided for the "Area of forestland owned" in that year. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, we can see that the value provided is '64893' for "Total Scope 2 emissions - market-based" and '137706' for "Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions - location-based". Similar to the previous tables, there is no specific value provided for the "Area of forestland owned" in that year. Therefore, based on the information in the third table, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot determine the area of forestland owned in the year 2021. 

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:42.656 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze the markdown tables provided:

1. LABOUR Table:
   - For the year 2021, the Rand value of employee training spend is R24 500 000.
   - The Total number of person days lost due to absenteeism is 127 for the year 2021.
   - There is no explicit mention of the average hours of training for the year 2021 in this table.

2. HEALTH AND SAFETY Table:
   - There is no information related to employee training spend or average hours of training in this table.

Based on the information provided in the LABOUR Table, the average hours of training in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '127.0'. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" cannot be determined from the given tables.

Are you sure that '25.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:49.918 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row that mentions "Spend with black-owned businesses as a % of total procurement spend (%)" shows a value of 25.4. This value represents the percentage of procurement spend with black-owned businesses in 2021. However, this value does not specifically indicate the procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot definitively state that "25.4" is the correct answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '12.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:25:59.921 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, we see that the number of board members is 12 and the number of board members who are deemed non-executive is 10. This means that there are 2 board members who are deemed executive in 2021.

Since the question is specifically asking about the number of board members over 50 in 2021, and we do not have explicit information about the age distribution of board members in that year, we cannot determine the exact number of board members over 50 in 2021 based on the provided tables.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '99314869.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Corporate office costs per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:05.844 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to corporate office costs or expenditures is not explicitly provided. The only information given for 2021 in this table is the Rand value of corporate social investment (CSI) / socioeconomic development (SED) expenditures, which is R99,314,869. There is no specific mention of corporate office costs in this table for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot determine the Corporate office costs per income statement.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:13.374 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table regarding ECONOMIC data, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values given are for 2022 and 2020, but there is no specific value mentioned for 2021. Therefore, based on the information in the table, it is not possible to determine that '36122000.0' is the correct answer to the question.

For the second markdown table regarding Metric data, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement is not relevant to the metrics listed in the table. The table provides information on the volume of products sold and the number of production facilities, but it does not include financial data related to acquisition costs. Therefore, the value '36122000.0' is not applicable in this context.

For the third markdown table regarding Topic data, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement is also not addressed in the table. The topics discussed are water management, responsible drinking, and marketing, with specific metrics related to legal proceedings and efforts to promote responsible consumption of alcohol. There is no mention of acquisition costs in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, it cannot be confirmed that '36122000.0' is the correct answer to the question about the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:24.067 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 1 (for 2021)
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Namibia only): * (not specified for 2021)

2. Table 2:
   - Number of reported occupational diseases (Distell Group): Not specified for 2021
   - Number of work-related fatalities (Distell Group): 1 (for 2021)

3. Table 3:
   - Number of injuries resulting in lost time (Distell Group): Not specified for 2021
   - Number of lost days (Distell Group): Not specified for 2021

Based on the information provided in the tables, there is no explicit mention of the "Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021" in any of the tables. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.
