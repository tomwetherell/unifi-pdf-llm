2024-03-09 15:02:01.241 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 1 in the year 2021, we need to subtract the Scope 2 emissions from the Total carbon emissions for that year. 

Given that the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 for 2021 is 134371 and the Scope 2 emissions for 2021 is 64893, we can calculate the Scope 1 emissions for 2021 by subtracting Scope 2 emissions from the Total emissions:

Scope 1 emissions (2021) = Total emissions (2021) - Scope 2 emissions (2021)
Scope 1 emissions (2021) = 134371 - 64893
Scope 1 emissions (2021) = 69478

Therefore, the Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 1 in the year 2021 is 69478.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:02:12.074 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 2 in the year 2021, we need to look at the row that specifies Scope 2 emissions. In the given table, the row that provides information on Scope 2 emissions is not explicitly labeled. However, we can infer that the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 includes both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions combined.

Given that the Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) - Scope 1 and 2 for 2021 is 134,371, this value represents the sum of both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021. Therefore, the Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) – Scope 2 in the year 2021 would be the difference between the total emissions and the Scope 1 emissions.

To calculate Scope 2 emissions for 2021:
Scope 2 emissions = Total emissions - Scope 1 emissions
Scope 2 emissions = 134,371 - (Value for Scope 1 emissions)

Since we do not have the specific value for Scope 1 emissions in the table, we cannot directly determine the Scope 2 emissions for 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Given that the table provides data for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, we can calculate the Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021 using the formula:

Scope 3 emissions (2021) = Total emissions (2021) - Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2021)

Total emissions (2021) = 134371
Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2021) = 64893

Therefore, Scope 3 emissions (2021) = 134371 - 64893 = 69478

So, the Carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2 e) – Scope 3 in the year 2021 is 69478.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:02:34.888 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for the year 2021, we need to calculate the number of LTIs per 200,000 person hours worked. The formula for LTIFR is (Number of LTIs / Total hours worked) * 200,000.

From the table provided:
- Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) reported in 2021 = 313155
- Total Number of recordable injuries reported in 2021 = 201183274

To calculate the total hours worked, we need additional information such as the total number of employees and their average working hours. Since this information is not available in the provided table, we cannot directly calculate the LTIFR for 2021.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

The percentage of management deemed 'HDSA' only tells us the proportion of 'HDSA' individuals within the management category, not the entire employee population.

Total revenue generated in South Africa in 2021 = (R6,363,636 / 72.7%) = R8,748,201.65

Therefore, the Rand value of total revenue generated in South Africa in the year 2021 is approximately R8,748,201.65.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:04:59.128 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Rand value of total taxation paid in South Africa in the year 2021 from the given table, we need to calculate it based on the percentage of total taxes paid in South Africa for that year.

Given that the percentage of total taxes paid in South Africa for 2021 is 80.6%, we can calculate the Rand value of total taxation paid in 2021 by using the formula:

Rand value of total taxation paid in 2021 = (Percentage of total taxes paid in South Africa for 2021 / 100) * Rand value of funds invested in research and development for 2021

Substitute the values into the formula:

Rand value of total taxation paid in 2021 = (80.6 / 100) * R33 428 000
Rand value of total taxation paid in 2021 = 0.806 * R33 428 000
Rand value of total taxation paid in 2021 = R26 932 728

Therefore, the Rand value of total taxation paid in South Africa in the year 2021 can be found in the given markdown table.

In this case, for the year 2021:
- Average compensation per executive director (excluding gains on the exercise of share options) = R7,623,000
- Total rand value of gains realized from LTIP awards - executive directors = R20,876,000

To find the total compensation paid to executive directors in 2021, we add these two values:
R7,623,000 + R20,876,000 = R28,499,000

Therefore, the total rand value of compensation paid to executive directors, including gains realized from LTIP awards in the year 2021, is R28,499,000.

The Total rand value of compensation paid to executive directors – including gains realized from LTIP awards in 2021 is not explicitly provided in this table. The table only shows the Average compensation per executive director and the Total rand value of gains realized from LTIP awards for each year.

Therefore, based on the information in the second table, we cannot determine the Total rand value of compensation paid to executive directors – including gains realized from LTIP awards in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:05:21.124 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Rand value of employee training spend in the year 2021, we need to calculate the difference between the total compensation paid to employees in 2021 and the net profit after tax per employee in 2021. This calculation will give us an estimate of how much of the total compensation was allocated to employee training.

Given that the total compensation paid to employees in 2021 is R2,879,251,000 and the net profit after tax per employee in 2021 is R515,441, we can calculate the estimated employee training spend as follows:

Employee Training Spend = Total Compensation Paid to Employees - (Net Profit After Tax per Employee * Number of Employees)

However, since the number of employees is not provided in the table, we cannot accurately determine the exact Rand value of employee training spend in 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:05:28.091 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total direct and indirect energy consumption in GJ in the year 2021, we need to consider both the direct consumption and the indirect consumption through electricity. In the provided table, the indirect energy consumption includes both electricity purchased and self-generated electricity.

The total indirect energy consumption in 2021 is given as 261,374 GJ. This includes both purchased electricity and self-generated electricity. However, to calculate the total direct and indirect energy consumption, we also need to consider the direct energy consumption, which is not explicitly provided in the table.

Since the table only provides information on indirect energy consumption and the percentage of self-generated electricity, we cannot directly determine the total direct and indirect energy consumption in GJ for 2021 from this table alone. Additional information on direct energy consumption is required to calculate the total energy consumption.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:05:34.155 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total direct and indirect energy consumption in gigajoules (GJ) in the year 2021, we need to sum up the direct energy consumption and the indirect energy consumption (electricity) for that year.

From the table, we can see that the direct energy consumption for 2021 is not explicitly provided. However, the total indirect energy consumption (electricity purchased + generated) in gigajoules for 2021 is given as 261,374 GJ.

To calculate the total direct energy consumption in gigajoules for 2021, we need to convert the total volume of electricity consumed (MWh) to gigajoules. Since 1 MWh is equal to 3.6 GJ, we can calculate the total direct energy consumption in gigajoules for 2021 by multiplying the total volume of electricity consumed (74033 MWh) by 3.6:

Total direct energy consumption (2021) = 74033 MWh * 3.6 GJ/MWh = 266,518.8 GJ

Now, we can find the total direct and indirect energy consumption in gigajoules for 2021 by summing up the direct and indirect energy consumption:

Total direct and indirect energy consumption (2021) = Total direct energy consumption (2021) + Total indirect energy consumption (2021)
Total direct and indirect energy consumption (2021) = 266,518.8 GJ + 261,374 GJ = 527,892.8 GJ

Therefore, the total direct and indirect energy consumption in gigajoules in the year 2021 is 527,892.8 GJ.

Looking at the column for the year 2021, we see that the value under this row is 74033 MWh. This value represents the total volume of electricity consumed, including both purchased and self-generated electricity, for the year 2021.

To isolate the self-generated electricity component, we need to subtract the purchased electricity from the total volume of electricity consumed.

For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Are you sure that '2196737.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:06:17.558 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first markdown table:

The Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '2196737' in the table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or Kl) – new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021?" is '2196737'.

For the second markdown table:

The Total volume of water consumed (kilolitres, or KI) - new purchases and/or abstractions (excluding recycled water used) in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. However, the baseline year for water reduction targets is provided as '2014'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the exact Total volume of water consumed in the year 2021.

Conclusion: 
Yes, '2196737.0' is the correct answer to the question for the first table, but for the second table, the answer is not explicitly stated, so we cannot confirm '2196737.0' as the correct value for the year 2021 in the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:06:19.854 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: Yes

Explanation:
1. Look for the row that contains the information about the "Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated".
2. Identify the column corresponding to the year 2021.
3. The value in the intersection of the row and column will provide the Total number of person hours worked (PHW) calculated in the year 2021.
4. In this case, the value in the table under the "2021" column and the "Total number of person hours worked (PHW) - calculated" row is 8098560, which represents the Total number of person hours worked (PHW) calculated in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:06:33.894 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total volume of electricity consumed (MWh) in the year 2021, we need to sum the purchased electricity and the self-generated electricity for that year. 

From the table:
- Total volume of electricity purchased in 2021 = 72,604 MWh
- Electricity self-generated in 2021 (converted to MWh) = 1,402,664 kWh / 1,000 = 1,402.664 MWh

Therefore, the total volume of electricity consumed in 2021 would be:
72,604 MWh (purchased) + 1,402.664 MWh (self-generated) = 74,006.664 MWh

So, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is 74,006.664 MWh for the year 2021.

This information is not directly provided in the table. However, we can use the Employee turnover rate for the year 2021 to estimate the total number of employees.

Given that the Employee turnover rate for 2021 is 21.1%, we can calculate the total number of employees at the end of 2021 using the formula:

Total number of employees at the end of 2021 = Total number of employees at the end of 2020 / (1 - Employee turnover rate for 2021)

Since the total number of employees at the end of 2020 is not provided in the table, we cannot directly calculate the total number of employees in 2021 using the information given in the table.

In this case, we are interested in the row that mentions "Number of board members who are deemed executive" and "Number of board members who are deemed 'independent'".

In the table provided:
- For the year 2021, the number of board members who are deemed executive is 2.
- For the year 2021, the number of board members who are deemed 'independent' is 8.

To find the total number of board members in 2021, we need to add the number of executive board members and independent board members together:
Total number of board members in 2021 = Number of executive board members + Number of independent board members
Total number of board members in 2021 = 2 + 8 = 10

Therefore, the total number of board members in the year 2021 is 10.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:07:27.382 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:

The Number of board members in 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. However, since the number of board members is consistent at 12 for all years, we can infer that the Number of board members in 2021 is also 12.

For the second table:

The Number of board members in 2021 is explicitly stated as 2 for board members who are deemed executive and 8 for board members who are deemed 'independent'. Therefore, the total Number of board members in 2021 is 10.

In the provided table, we have the following information for the year 2021:
- Average length of executive director service: 7.5 years
- Average length of non-executive director service: 9 years

To calculate the average length of director (full board) service, we would typically take the average of these two values. In this case, it would be (7.5 + 9) / 2 = 8.25 years.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is approximately 8.25 years for the year 2021.

From the table provided:
- Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e) for Scope 1 and 2 in 2021 is 134,371
- Carbon emissions (Tonnes CO2e) for Scope 3 in 2021 is 296,909

To find the total carbon emissions for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in 2021, we need to add these two values together:
134,371 (Scope 1 and 2) + 296,909 (Scope 3) = 431,280

Therefore, the total carbon emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in the year 2021 is 431,280.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:08:40.552 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021, we need to calculate the ratio of non-executive board members to the total number of board members in 2021 and then convert it to a percentage.

In this case, the number of board members in 2021 is given as 12, and the number of board members who are deemed non-executive in 2021 is given as 10.

To calculate the percentage of non-executive board members in 2021:
Percentage = (Number of non-executive board members / Total number of board members) * 100
Percentage = (10 / 12) * 100
Percentage = 83.33%

Therefore, the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive in the year 2021 is 83.33%.

2024-03-09 15:08:49.448 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021, we need to look for a row in the table that specifically mentions the independence status of board members. In the provided table, there is no row that directly provides information about the independence status of board members for each year. The table only includes information about the number and percentage of board members who are women.

Since there is no information related to the independence status of board members in the table, we cannot determine the percentage of board members who are deemed 'independent' in the year 2021 based on the given data.

Conclusion: No

In the given table, there is no specific row that mentions CO emissions. The closest relevant row is "Total emissions," which provides the total emissions for each year. However, this row does not break down the emissions by specific pollutants like CO.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot directly determine the Air emissions of CO in the year 2021.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:09:13.088 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for "Stationary combustion" provides values for the years 2014*1, 20151, 2016, 20171, 20181, 2019, 20202, 2021, and 2022. However, the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in this row.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:09:16.714 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021, we need to look at the values under the corresponding pollutant category in the table. In this case, we are interested in NOx emissions, which are typically associated with combustion processes.

Looking at the table, we can see that the values provided are for Stationary combustion emissions. The values under the '2021' column represent the emissions data for the year 2021. Therefore, to find the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in 2021, we need to locate the value under the '2021' column in the 'Stationary combustion' row.

The value under the '2021' column and 'Stationary combustion' row is 63656. This value represents the Stationary combustion emissions for the year 2021. Since NOx emissions are commonly associated with combustion processes, it is likely that the value 63656 corresponds to the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021.

Conclusion: Yes

In the given table, there is a row labeled "Total emissions" which provides the total emissions for each year, including the year 2021. To determine the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in 2021, we need to check if NOx is included in the total emissions for that year.

Since the table does not provide a breakdown of specific pollutants like NOx (excluding N2O) for each year, we cannot directly determine the Air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021 from this table.

2024-03-09 15:09:34.007 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) in the year 2021, we need to look at the row corresponding to "Scope 1 direct emissions" and the column corresponding to the year 2021.

In the given table, the row "Scope 1 direct emissions" does not have any specific values listed for the pollutant "particulate matter (PM10)". The only value provided in the table is for "Stationary combustion" emissions.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the Air emissions of particulate matter (PM10) specifically for the year 2021.

However, the table provided only contains information about corporate social investment (CSI) and socioeconomic development (SED) expenditures, as well as the percentage of CSI/SED spend relative to total revenue generated.

Since the table does not directly provide information on assets under management by asset class, it is not possible to answer the question based on the data presented in the table. The table primarily focuses on CSI/SED expenditures and their relationship to total revenue, rather than assets under management by asset class.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

2. The "SASB code" column likely refers to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) code for the specific metric being discussed. It does not indicate information about assets under management.

3. The "Metric" column describes the specific metric being measured or reported. In this case, the metrics are related to social and environmental impacts, ingredient sourcing, and water stress. There is no mention of assets under management in this column.

4. The "Our response" column provides information about where the data or response can be found, such as in a sustainability report or online source. Again, there is no indication of assets under management in this column.

Based on the analysis of the table, it does not contain information related to the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021.

In this table, there are two rows related to forestland:
1. Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biogas4
2. Outside of Scope 1, 2 and 3 - biomass (wood chips)

However, neither of these rows explicitly mentions forestland ownership. The values in these rows seem to represent different types of biomass or biogas, not the area of forestland owned.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:11:39.190 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: To find the average hours of training in the year 2021, we need to divide the total number of person hours worked (PHW) by the Rand value of employee training spend for that year.

For the year 2021:
Total number of person hours worked (PHW) = 8098560
Rand value of employee training spend = R24 500 000

To calculate the average hours of training in 2021:
Average hours of training = Total PHW / Rand value of training spend
Average hours of training = 8098560 / 24500000 ≈ 0.33

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Average hours of training in the year 2021?" is approximately 0.33.

Conclusion: No, '8098560.0' is not the correct answer to the question.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:12:03.774 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021, we need to divide the Rand value of employee training spend for 2021 by the total number of person hours worked in 2021. 

From the table:
- Rand value of employee training spend for 2021 is R24,500,000
- Total number of person hours worked in 2021 is 8,098,560

To calculate the average number of hours of training per employee in 2021:
Average training hours per employee = Rand value of employee training spend / Total number of person hours worked
Average training hours per employee = R24,500,000 / 8,098,560 ≈ 3.02 hours

Therefore, the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021 can be found in the table.

To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) as a % of total spend in the year 2021, we would typically need a different table that specifically outlines financial data related to BBBEE procurement spend and total spend broken down by different categories, including QSEs.

Step 2: Examine the table - The table provided contains recommended disclosures related to climate-related risks and opportunities. It includes descriptions of the board's oversight and management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

Step 3: Analyze the table - The table specifically mentions disclosures related to climate-related risks and opportunities, which are a subset of ESG factors. While the table does not directly address the broader incorporation of ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes, it does provide insights into how organizations are addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.

Step 4: Conclusion - Based on the analysis, the table does not directly answer the question about the overall approach to incorporating ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes in 2021. However, it does offer information on a specific aspect (climate-related risks and opportunities) that is part of the broader ESG framework.

The table consists of two columns: "Recommended disclosures" and "References."

The question is asking for the description of the approach to the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021. The table, on the other hand, provides recommended disclosures related to climate-related risks and opportunities identified by an organization, as well as their impact on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. The references provided in the table are related to the CDP Climate Response 2021 questionnaire.

While the table does provide information about climate-related risks and opportunities, it does not directly address the broader question about the approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes and strategies in 2021. The disclosures in the table focus specifically on climate-related aspects and their impact on the organization, rather than the overall ESG integration approach in investment and wealth management.

2024-03-09 15:14:08.413 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the description of the approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Metric" column in the markdown table. Specifically, we are interested in the metrics related to marketing and advertising practices, as these are typically the channels through which companies inform customers about their products and services.

In this table, the metrics related to marketing and advertising practices are:
1. Percentage of total advertising impressions made on individuals at or above the legal drinking age (Metric: FB-AB-270a.1)
2. Number of incidents of non-compliance with industry or regulatory labeling and/or marketing codes (Metric: FB-AB-270a.2)

The description of the approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021 may be found in the details provided for these metrics, such as the methodology used, the results obtained, and any specific initiatives or strategies implemented by the company.

Therefore, the answer to the question can potentially be found in the information related to these metrics in the markdown table.
