Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:33:53.799 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is listed as '0' but it does not specify whether this is the FIFR for that year. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it is not possible to definitively state that the FIFR for 2021 is '0.0'.

In the second table, the FIFR for 2021 is explicitly stated as '0'. Therefore, in this case, we can confidently say that the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021 is '0.0'.

In the third table, the FIFR for 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is listed as '2.5' but it does not specify whether this is the FIFR for that year. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it is not possible to definitively state that the FIFR for 2021 is '2.5'.

Conclusion: 
Based on the information provided in the tables, we can confidently say '0.0' is the correct answer to the question for the second table, but for the first and third tables, we cannot definitively determine the FIFR for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '3.6' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:33:57.092 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The GHG Scope 1 emissions for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided in the table. The value '3.6' is for the year 2023, not 2021.

For the second table:
- The GHG Scope 1 emissions for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided in the table. The value '3.6' is for the year 2023, not 2021.

Therefore, based on the information in the tables, '3.6' is not the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG Scope 1 emissions in the year 2021?"

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:02.428 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the GHG emissions intensity for Scope 2 emissions is not explicitly provided (marked as "-"). Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot confirm that the value for GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021 is 7.1.

Looking at the second table, for the year 2021, the GHG emissions intensity for Scope 3 emissions is provided as 4.2, but there is no specific value given for Scope 2 emissions. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the value for GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021 is 7.1.

In the third table, the GHG emissions for Scope 2 emissions are not mentioned at all.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively state that the GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021 were 7.1.

Are you sure that '4.2' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:05.116 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the GHG Scope 3 emissions value is not explicitly provided. The value '4.2' is actually for the year 2023 in the first row of the table. Therefore, based on the information given in the tables, we cannot determine the GHG Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '0.74' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:10.855 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually to determine the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021.

Table 1:
- The table does not explicitly provide the LTIFR for the year 2021. It only mentions the Total Number of Recordable Injuries for each year.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the LTIFR for 2021 from this table.

Table 2:
- The table does not mention the LTIFR for the year 2021. It only provides the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for each year.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the LTIFR for 2021 from this table.

Table 3:
- The table provides the Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for the year 2021, which is 1157.
- However, the LTIFR calculation requires the total number of hours worked, which is not provided in the table.
- Without the total number of hours worked, we cannot calculate the LTIFR for 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No, we cannot determine the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021 from the provided tables.

Are you sure that '102.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs, i.e. injuries on duty leading to medical treatment, but no lost days) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:15.696 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) is listed as 102. However, it is important to note that the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the second table, so we cannot confirm if it is indeed 102 for that year.

In the third table, the value for the year 2021 is again listed as 102 for the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs). Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can conclude that the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) in the year 2021 is 102.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:20.658 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is not explicitly provided. The cell corresponding to FY21 is empty, so we cannot determine the exact number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is explicitly stated as 0. This indicates that there were no environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 according to this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" is explicitly stated as 0. This is not the same metric as the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents" and does not provide information on incidents with a negative impact.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot definitively conclude that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was 0. The first table does not provide the information, and the other tables provide different metrics.

Conclusion: No.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:25.642 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is indicated as '0'. This means that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this specific table.

In the second table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is also indicated as '0', confirming that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table for the year 2021, the Total Number of Recordable Injuries includes MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities, but the specific number of fatalities is not provided. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the exact number of work-related fatalities for the year 2021 from this table alone.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021?" is '0' for the first two tables, but it cannot be definitively determined from the third table.

Are you sure that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:37.778 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '1259' corresponds to the Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries specifically for the year 2021.

For the second table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '1259'. Therefore, '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 for this table.

For the third table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '102' corresponds to the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries specifically for the year 2021 in this table.

Are you sure that '53.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:46.551 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table regarding ESG/Sustainability Databook, the value for "Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021" is not explicitly provided. The table only shows percentages related to clothing sourcing.

For the second and third tables under Highlights, there is no specific mention of the procurement value from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021. The highlighted points focus on other aspects such as store openings, local procurement, sustainable practices, and support for suppliers.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the answer to the question "What was the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Are you sure that '15.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment, development, support of housing, sanitation, energy, telecoms and other community-related needs (consolidated CSI Spend) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:50.082 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the tables individually:

1. In the first table, for the year 2021, the spend on infrastructure and services investment is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but not for FY21.

2. In the second table, for the year 2021, the spend on infrastructure and services investment is also not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but not for FY21.

3. In the third table, for the year 2021, the spend on infrastructure and services investment is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but not for FY21.

Based on the information available in the tables, we cannot determine the spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is **no**.

Are you sure that '1006000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total water consumed in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:34:57.065 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is stated as '1.006e+06', which is equivalent to 1,006,000 kilolitres.

In the second table, the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is stated as '1006000', which is also equivalent to 1,006,000 kilolitres.

In the third table, there is no explicit value provided for the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total water consumed in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:00.728 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The value of '53.4' is not provided for the year 2021 in this table.

Moving on to the second table, the total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021 is also not explicitly stated. The value of '53.4' is not provided for the year 2021 in this table either.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, I cannot confirm that '53.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021?".

Are you sure that '2.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total recordable injury incedence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:12.070 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is listed as 2.5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '2.5'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is no specific value provided for the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR). Therefore, we cannot determine the TRIIR for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is listed as 2.5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '2.5'.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" is '2.5'. 

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '15.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of Board Members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:28.136 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Number of Board Members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 15. Therefore, '15.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

For the second table, the Number of Board Members in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The closest information provided is for the year 2020, which is 13. Therefore, '15.0' is not the correct answer for this table.

For the third table, the Number of Board Members in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The information provided is for the year 2020, which is 6. Therefore, '15.0' is not the correct answer for this table.

Looking at the second table, in the row corresponding to the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number for the year 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '7.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of independent board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:36.543 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The number of independent board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- The value for the year 2021 is provided for the number of independent board members in the previous years (FY22, FY21, FY20).
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of independent board members in the year 2021 from this table.

For the second table:
- The number of independent board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- The value for the year 2021 is provided for the number of board members who are deemed Non-Executive.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of independent board members in the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:
- The number of independent board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- The value for the year 2021 is provided for the percentage of board members who are deemed Non-Executive.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of independent board members in the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No, we cannot determine the number of independent board members in the year 2021 from the provided tables.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:45.137 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the table with the heading "ESG/Sustainability Databook" and the row "Average Age of Directors (in years)", the data for the year 2021 is 59.2. This is not the same as the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is no.

For the table with the heading "ESG/Sustainability Databook" and the row "Number of Board Members who are deemed 'Independent'", the data for the year 2021 is 7. This is not the same as the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is no.

Are you sure that '1991.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of retail locations in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:49.212 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the Number of New Stores Opened and Total Store Floorspace for all years, but not specifically for 2021.

In the second table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is given as 1172 under the row "Number of Company-owned Stores".

In the third table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the Number of Associate-owned Stores and Number of New Stores Opened for all years, but not specifically for 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of retail locations in the year 2021?" is '1172'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:35:56.945 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for "FY21" states "0" for both "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" and "Total Number of Environmental Complaints".
- There is no specific mention of fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021 were "0.0".

For the second table:
- The row for "FY21" states "0" for "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances".
- Similar to the first table, there is no specific mention of fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021.
- Again, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021 were "0.0".

For the third table:
- The row for "FY21" states "0" for "Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings (including fines) due to fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anti-competitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice or violations of other industry laws or regulations".
- There is no specific mention of fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021 in this table as well.
- Once again, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021 were "0.0".

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact value of Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:00.637 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, for the year 2021, the Carbon Intensity value is not explicitly provided. The values given are 14.8 for FY23, 15.0 for FY22, and 13.3 for FY20. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that '13.6' is the correct answer for the Carbon Intensity in 2021.

In conclusion, based on the information in the first table, we cannot determine the Carbon Intensity value for 2021.

Are you sure that '7.75' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:04.226 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for "Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW)" in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is given as "7.75", but it is not specified if this value corresponds to the year 2021.

In the second table, the value for the same metric in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as "7.75".

In the third table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 for "Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW)".

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021?" is 'Yes'.

Are you sure that '2.2' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:18.208 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the row related to "Auditor Remuneration: % of Non-audit Fees" shows a value of 2.2%. This value represents the percentage of non-audit fees in the year 2021, not the advisory fees. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, '2.2' is not the correct answer to the question: "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021?".

Yes

2024-03-04 21:36:18.209 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:convert_unit:366 - Unit conversion prompt:

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 2.2 Percentage in rand?

Are you sure that '1372210.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (5)  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:26.068 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table, the row for "Total Carbon Emissions (tonnes CO2e)" provides the values for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The value for the year 2021 is given as 1372210 tonnes CO2e.

Therefore, the value of 1372210.0 is not the correct answer to the question about the Air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '2.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:29.876 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is 2.5. This value represents the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and not the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked). The All Injury Frequency Rate calculation requires the total number of injuries and the total number of hours worked, which are not explicitly provided in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table for the year 2021, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for that year.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:33.742 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 does not have a value provided for the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues."
- Therefore, we cannot determine the amount for the year 2021 from this table.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 provides the value of "39.1" for the "Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures."
- This value does not correspond to the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues."
- Therefore, we cannot determine the amount for the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 does not have a value provided for the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues."
- Therefore, we cannot determine the amount for the year 2021 from this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

2024-03-04 21:36:42.353 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is:

| 204 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects | 1.5 |

This row provides the value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects for the year 2021, which is 1.5. This value does not represent the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021?" based on this table is **no**.

For the second table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is:

| 205 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Skills Development, including Adult Basic Education & Training (ABET) | 3.3 |

This row provides the value of CSI/SED Spend on Skills Development for the year 2021, which is 3.3. This value also does not represent the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021?" based on this table is **no**.

For the third table:

The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The table only shows data for FY23, FY22, and FY20. Therefore, we cannot determine the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ integration of environmental issues for the year 2021 based on this table. 

Conclusion: The correct answer based on the information provided in the tables is **no**.

Are you sure that '1.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental, social, and governance issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:50.754 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The value '41.3' corresponds to the "198 Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures" for the year 2021, not the assets under management.

For the second table, the value '41.3' is indeed the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021. This information is provided under the row "198 Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures" for the year 2021.

For the third table, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. The value '14.3' corresponds to the "202 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Basic Needs & Social Development, including Nutrition and/or Feeding Programmes" for the year 2021, not the assets under management.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '1.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:36:59.330 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the relevant row is:

| 204 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects | 1.5 |

This row provides the value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects for the year 2021, which is 1.5 Rand Million. This value does not correspond to the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ sustainability themed investing. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021?" based on this table is **no**.

Now, let's check the second table for the year 2021:

| 205 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Skills Development, including Adult Basic Education & Training (ABET) | 3.3 |

In this table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 provides the value of CSI/SED Spend on Skills Development, including Adult Basic Education & Training (ABET), which is 3.3 Rand Million. This value also does not relate to the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ sustainability themed investing. Therefore, the answer to the question based on this table is also **no**.

Lastly, let's examine the third table for the year 2021:

| 198 Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures | 41.3 |

In this table, the row for the year 2021 gives the value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures, which is 41.3 Rand Million. This value is not specifically related to the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ sustainability themed investing. Therefore, the answer to the question based on this table is **no**.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is **no**.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:07.891 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" in the year 2021 shows a value of 0.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row for "Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings (including fines) due to fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anti-competitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice or violations of other industry laws or regulations" in the year 2021 shows a value of 0.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the third table:
- The row for "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" in the year 2021 shows a value of 0.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot determine the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:15.032 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values are given for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing.

In the second table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 100.0%.

In the third table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is also explicitly stated as 100.0%.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?" is '100.0%'.

Are you sure that '54.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:22.405 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the BBBEE procurement spend is not explicitly mentioned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 from this table.

Moving on to the second table, the value for the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 is provided as '54.5'. Therefore, based on the information in the second table, the correct answer to the question is '54.5'.

Considering the third table, the BBBEE procurement spend is not mentioned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the value from this table.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the second table, the correct answer to the question is '54.5'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Are you sure that '15.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:28.741 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the number of Board Members is provided as 15. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021?" is '15.0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the number of Board Members is provided as 15. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021?" is '15.0'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the number of Board Members is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of Board Members between 30 - 50 for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer is '15.0' for the first two tables, but we cannot determine the exact number from the third table.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:33.713 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the number of Board Members over 50 is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the total number of Board Members and the number of Non-Executive Board Members for each year. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of Board Members over 50 for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the number of Board Members over 50 is also not explicitly provided. The table only shows the number of Board Members who are Women and the percentage of Board Members who are Women for each year. Again, we cannot determine the exact number of Board Members over 50 for the year 2021 from this table.

Finally, in the third table for the year 2021, the percentage of Board Members who are deemed 'HDSA' is provided, but this does not give us information about the number of Board Members over 50 specifically.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the number of Board Members over 50 in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '4.27' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:42.297 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:

The row "200 CSI Spend as a Percentage of Net Profit after Tax (NPAT)" provides information for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. The cost relating to acquisition per income statement is not explicitly mentioned in this row for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021.

For the second table:

The row "12 Rand Billion Value of Total Discretionary/Measured Procurement Spend (South Africa Only)" provides information for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. The cost relating to acquisition per income statement is not explicitly mentioned in this row for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021.

For the third table:

The row "201 Percentage of Total CSI/SED Spend in South Africa" provides information for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. The cost relating to acquisition per income statement is not explicitly mentioned in this row for the year 2021. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '41.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:37:50.387 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value '41.3' corresponds to the Rand million value of ESG investment in the year 2021. This does not directly answer the question about the description of the approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies for that year.

Moving on to the second table, the row related to the year 2021 mentions the Rand million value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures, which is not directly related to the description of the approach to ESG factors in investment and wealth management.

In the third table, the row for the year 2021 includes the Rand million value of CSI/SED Spend on Education and the Rand million value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects. Again, these values do not provide the description of the approach to ESG factors in investment and wealth management for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the answer to the question about the description of the approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

The value '1259' corresponds to the total number of recordable injuries in the year 2021. There is no explicit mention of the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021 in this table. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table alone, we cannot confirm if '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-04 21:38:06.092 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 is not explicitly providing information on the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products.
- The value '0.0' is not mentioned in the table for the year 2021 in relation to this question.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 is explicitly stating that the Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3) is 0 for that year.
- The value '0.0' is mentioned in the table for the year 2021, but it is related to environmental incidents, not the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 is not explicitly providing information on the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products.
- The value '0.0' is not mentioned in the table for the year 2021 in relation to this question.

Conclusion: No, '0.0' is not the correct answer based on the provided tables.
