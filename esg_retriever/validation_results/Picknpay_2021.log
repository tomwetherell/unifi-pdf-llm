2024-03-09 15:15:15.215 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021, we need to look at the row that specifies the spend on B-BBEE businesses in Rand billion for FY21.

From the provided markdown table, we can see that the value for the spend on B-BBEE businesses in Rand billion for FY21 is 54.5. This value represents the total spend on B-BBEE businesses in that fiscal year.

To determine the specific breakdown of this spend into categories such as Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned, we would need additional information or a more detailed breakdown within the table. 

Therefore, based on the information available in the provided markdown table, we cannot directly extract the exact answer to the question about the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:15:35.269 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021, we need to calculate the FIFR using the formula:

FIFR = (Number of Fatalities / Total Hours Worked) x 1,000,000

Looking at the provided table, we can see that the table includes the Total Number of Recordable Injuries, which includes fatalities, for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. However, the table does not provide the specific number of fatalities for each year.

Since the table does not directly provide the number of fatalities for the year 2021, we cannot calculate the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for that specific year using the information given in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021?" cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:15:38.227 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is not explicitly provided. The value for FIFR in 2021 is not mentioned in the table. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, we cannot determine that the FIFR in 2021 was '0.0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is explicitly stated as '0' for that year. Therefore, in this case, we can conclude that the FIFR in 2021 was '0.0'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:16:03.820 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021, we need to look at the row that provides information specifically about Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021. In this table, row 170 provides the GHG Emissions Intensity for Scope 3 Emissions expressed as Metric tonnes of CO2e per unit of Million Rands. The data for this row includes values for FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20.

Since we are interested in the GHG Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021, we should focus on the FY21 column under row 170. If there is a numerical value present in the FY21 column, that would indicate the GHG Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021. If the value is represented as a dash "-", it means that the data for GHG Scope 3 emissions in 2021 is not available or not applicable.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we can determine whether the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021 can be found. If there is a numerical value present in the FY21 column under row 170, then the answer is 'yes'. If the value is represented as a dash "-", then the answer is 'no'.

So, the answer is: 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:16:11.129 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021, we need to calculate it using the formula:

LTIFR = (Number of Lost Time Injuries / Total Hours Worked) x 1,000,000

From the table provided, we can see that the Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) in the year 2021 was 1157 (under the FY21 column). However, to calculate the LTIFR, we also need the total hours worked, which is not available in this table. Since the total hours worked data is missing, we cannot calculate the LTIFR for the year 2021 using the information provided in this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021?" based on the information in this table is NO.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:16:39.531 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is not explicitly provided. The cell corresponding to FY21 is empty, indicating that there is no specific value mentioned for this year. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is explicitly stated as '0'. Therefore, in this case, we can confidently say that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was indeed '0'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" is explicitly stated as '0'. This table does not provide information on the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 based on this table.

Conclusion: 
For the first table, we cannot determine the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021.
For the second table, the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.
For the third table, we cannot determine the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:16:47.584 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and fatalities" row in the table. Specifically, we need to focus on the "FY21" column, which represents the data for the fiscal year 2021.

In the FY21 column, the value under the "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and fatalities" row is 1259. This number includes all types of recordable injuries, not just fatalities. To isolate the number of work-related fatalities, we need to look for a specific row that provides the data for fatalities only.

In this table, there is a row labeled "Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR, i.e. number of Fatalities per 200 000 person hours worked)" which provides the frequency rate of fatalities but not the actual count of fatalities. Since there is no specific row that directly states the number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021, we cannot find the answer to the question in this table.

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Explanation:
1. Look for the row that corresponds to the "Percentage of Board Members who are Women" in the table.
2. Find the value under the "FY21" column, which represents the data for the year 2021.
3. The value in the "FY21" column is 33.3%, which is the percentage of female board members in the year 2021.
4. Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:17:27.018 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of female board members in the year 2021 from the given table, we need to look for specific data related to board gender diversity in FY21. 

From the table, we can see that row 53 indicates that the company's policy on Board Gender Diversity is publicly available for all fiscal years including FY21. However, this row does not provide the actual percentage of female board members.

Row 54 mentions that the company publicly provides targets with respect to Board Gender Diversity for all fiscal years including FY21. Again, this row does not give us the specific percentage of female board members in FY21.

Based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the percentage of female board members in the year 2021. 

Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:17:32.683 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021, we need to calculate the proportion of electricity self-generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, etc.) to the total electricity consumed in that year. 

From the table, we can see that in FY21:
- Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated = 7773 MWh
- Total Volume of Electricity Consumed = 780798 MWh

To calculate the Percentage Renewable Energy in 2021:
Percentage Renewable Energy = (Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated / Total Volume of Electricity Consumed) * 100
Percentage Renewable Energy = (7773 / 780798) * 100 ≈ 0.994%

Therefore, the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 is approximately 0.994%.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:17:36.463 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021, we need to calculate the proportion of electricity that was self-generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, or other) out of the total volume of electricity purchased. 

From the table, we can see that in FY21:
- Total Volume of Electricity Purchased (MWh) was 773,025
- Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated (MWh) was 7,773

To calculate the Percentage Renewable Energy in 2021, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Renewable Energy} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated}}{\text{Total Volume of Electricity Purchased}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Renewable Energy} = \left( \frac{7,773}{773,025} \right) \times 100 \approx 1.005\% \]

Therefore, the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 was approximately 1.005%.

Are you sure that '50.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:17:45.863 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:

In the row for the year 2021, we have the following relevant information:
- Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated (MWh) in 2021: 7773
- Total Volume of Electricity Consumed (MWh) in 2021: 780798

To calculate the Percentage Renewable Energy in 2021, we need to find the proportion of self-generated electricity out of the total electricity consumed:
Percentage Renewable Energy = (Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated / Total Volume of Electricity Consumed) * 100
Percentage Renewable Energy = (7773 / 780798) * 100 ≈ 0.995%

Therefore, the correct answer for the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 based on the first table is approximately 0.995%.

For the second table:

In the row for the year 2021, we have the following relevant information:
- Total Volume of Electricity Purchased (MWh) in 2021: 773025
- Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated (MWh) in 2021: 7773

To calculate the Percentage Renewable Energy in 2021, we need to find the proportion of self-generated electricity out of the total electricity consumed:
Percentage Renewable Energy = (Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated / (Total Volume of Electricity Purchased + Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated)) * 100
Percentage Renewable Energy = (7773 / (773025 + 7773)) * 100 ≈ 0.996%

Therefore, the correct answer for the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 based on the second table is approximately 0.996%.

Conclusion: No, '50.1' is not the correct answer for the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 based on the provided tables.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:17:49.864 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021, we need to look at the "FY21" column in the table. Specifically, we are interested in the values under the "Spend on Black-owned Businesses in Rand billion" and "Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion" rows.

In the "FY21" column:
- Spend on Black-owned Businesses in Rand billion: 7.7
- Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion: 5.2

To calculate the total procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned, we add these two values together:
7.7 (Black-owned) + 5.2 (Black Women-owned) = 12.9 billion Rand

Therefore, the total procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021 is 12.9 billion Rand.

In this case, the relevant row is "128 Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion."

Looking at the values in the "FY21" column under this row, we see that the value is "5.2." This represents the spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is 5.2 billion Rand.

Are you sure that '7.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Are you sure that '773025.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:18:24.949 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the total volume of electricity consumed is provided as 780798 MWh. However, the specific value for the total energy from renewable fuels consumed is not explicitly stated in this table for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the total volume of electricity purchased (excluding self-generated from renewable sources) is given as 773025 MWh. This value represents the total volume of electricity purchased, not specifically the total energy from renewable fuels consumed.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be confirmed that 773025.0 is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021?"

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:18:45.332 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:

The total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated in the table. The values provided in the table are for the last financial year, not specifically for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact total local/BBBEE procurement for the year 2021 based on the information given in the table.

For the second table:

The spend on B-BBEE businesses in the year 2021 is stated as 54.5 rand billion. This value corresponds to the year in question, which is FY21. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021?" based on the second table is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:18:51.766 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021, we need to look at the row with the label "Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules" and specifically at the value under the "FY21" column. The value in the FY21 column is 2.81087e+06, which represents the energy consumption in gigajoules for the year 2021.

To convert gigajoules to megawatt hours, we need to use the conversion factor that 1 gigajoule is equal to 0.277778 megawatt hours. Therefore, to find the total megawatt hours electricity consumed in 2021, we can multiply the gigajoules value by the conversion factor:

2.81087e+06 gigajoules * 0.277778 megawatt hours/gigajoule = 780,800 megawatt hours

So, the total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021 is 780,800.

2024-03-09 15:18:54.449 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021, we need to look for the relevant data in the table. The closest information we have is in row 150, which provides the "Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW)" for different fiscal years, including FY21 (which corresponds to the year 2021).

However, this row gives the average electricity consumed per person hour worked in kilowatt-hours (kWh), not the total megawatt hours electricity consumed for the entire year. To calculate the total megawatt hours consumed, we would need additional information such as the total number of person hours worked in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:19:13.345 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021, we need to look at the "Total Number of Recordable Injuries" for FY21 in the table. The value for FY21 under the "Total Number of Recordable Injuries" column is 1259. This represents the total number of recordable injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities for the year 2021.

To calculate the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR), we would typically use the formula:

\[ \text{TRIIR} = \frac{\text{Total recordable injuries}}{\text{Total hours worked}} \]

However, since we only have the total number of recordable injuries and not the total hours worked in the table, we cannot calculate the TRIIR directly from the information provided.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" cannot be found in the given markdown table.

2024-03-09 15:19:24.717 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excl. infrastructure investments in the year 2021, we need to look at the row with the relevant information in the table. In this case, the row that provides the information we need is row 198, which states the "Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures" for each fiscal year.

Looking at the FY21 column in row 198, we can see that the value is 41.3 Rand Million. This represents the spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excl. infrastructure investments in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the table, and it is 41.3 Rand Million for the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Rand Million Value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation in the year 2021?" based on the first table is '135'.

Looking at the second table, for the year 2021, the Rand Million Value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation is not explicitly stated. The value provided in the second table is for the year 2020. Therefore, based on the second table, we cannot confirm that the Rand Million Value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation in the year 2021 was '135'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:19:41.261 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the number of board members in the year 2021, we need to look at the "FY21" column in the table. In row 27, the number of board members deemed Executive in FY21 is listed as 5. In row 28, the number of board members deemed Independent in FY21 is listed as 7. 

To determine the total number of board members in FY21, we need to sum the number of Executive and Independent board members. So, 5 (Executive) + 7 (Independent) = 12.

Therefore, the total number of board members in the year 2021 is 12.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:19:56.927 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the Percentage of Board Members who are deemed Non-Executive and the Number of Board Members who are deemed Executive. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of executive board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is explicitly stated as 5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of executive board members in the year 2021?" based on this table is '5'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the Number of Board Members and the Number of Board Members who are deemed Non-Executive. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of executive board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: No, '5.0' is not the correct answer for the Number of executive board members in the year 2021 based on the information provided in the tables.

In the given table, the columns include information related to ESG/Sustainability Databook, fiscal years (FY23, FY22, FY21, FY20), GRI Standards, SASB Standards, JSE, and COMMENTS.

Since the question is specifically about the number of independent board members in the year 2021, we should focus on the row that contains this information. However, based on the provided table, there is no row that directly mentions the number of independent board members for each fiscal year. The table mainly includes information related to board chairman independence, board conflicts of interest, and other policies.

Therefore, based on the information available in the provided table, the answer to the question "What was the Number of independent board members in the year 2021?" cannot be found in this table.

Explanation:
1. Look for the row that describes the number of non-executive board members.
2. Find the column for the year 2021 (FY21).
3. The value in the cell where the row and column intersect will give you the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021.
4. In this case, the value in the cell for row 25 and column FY21 is 10, which represents the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:20:32.799 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Average Length of Director (full Board) Service in the year 2021 is 11.3 years.
- This value represents the number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021.
- Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021?" is '11.3'.

For the second table:
- The Average Length of Director (full Board) Service in the year 2021 is not provided in this table.
- We cannot determine the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:
- The Average Length of Director (full Board) Service in the year 2021 is not provided in this table.
- We cannot determine the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021 from this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, the correct answer to the question is 'yes'.

Explanation:
1. Look for the row that contains the information about "Carbon Intensity: Average Volume of Carbon Emissions per Person Hour Worked (tonnes CO2e/PHW)".
2. Identify the column for the year 2021 (FY21).
3. The value in the cell where the row and column intersect is the Carbon Intensity for the year 2021.
4. In this case, the value in the cell for FY21 is 13.6 tonnes CO2e/PHW, which is the Carbon Intensity for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question can be found in the provided markdown table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:21:05.814 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon Intensity for the year 2021, we need to look for the metric that specifically mentions carbon emissions per person hour worked. In the provided table, the closest relevant metric is "153 Total Energy Efficiency: Total Direct Energy & Indirect Energy Consumed per Person Hour Worked [MJ/PHW)." This metric provides information on energy consumption per person hour worked but does not directly mention carbon emissions.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the Carbon Intensity (tonnes CO2 e/PHW) for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '13.6' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Carbon Intensity: Average Volume of Carbon Emissions per Person Hour Worked (tonnes CO2 e/PHW) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:21:13.259 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: In the first table, the Carbon Intensity value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are 14.8 for FY23, 15.0 for FY22, and 13.3 for FY20. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the Carbon Intensity value for the year 2021.

In the second table, the Carbon Footprint values are provided for Total Carbon Emissions for different years, but there is no specific value mentioned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the Carbon Intensity value for the year 2021 from this table either.

Conclusion: Based on the information in the provided tables, we cannot confirm that '13.6' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Carbon Intensity for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:21:20.225 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021, we need to look at the row with the relevant data in the table. In this case, the data we are interested in is in row 153, under the column for FY21 (2021).

The value provided in the table for FY21 under row 153 is represented in Megajoules per Person Hour Worked (MJ/PHW), not in kilowatt-hours (kWh) as required. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the Electricity Efficiency in kWh/PHW for the year 2021 from this table without further conversion calculations.

In conclusion, based on the information available in the provided table, we cannot directly determine the Electricity Efficiency in kWh/PHW for the year 2021.

In this case, the value for FY21 is 7.

To calculate the percentage of independent board members, we need to divide the number of independent board members by the total number of board members and then multiply by 100.

In this table, the total number of board members is not explicitly provided. We only have the number of executive board members for each year. Without knowing the total number of board members, we cannot calculate the percentage of independent board members for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:22:37.738 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to look for a metric that represents the total number of injuries per million hours worked. In the provided table, the closest metrics we have are the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR).

The LTIFR is defined as the number of Lost Time Injuries per 200,000 person hours worked, which is not directly in terms of injuries per million hours worked. The TRIFR is the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate, but it does not specify the unit of hours worked.

Since neither of the metrics in the table directly provides the All Injury Frequency Rate in the desired unit of injuries per million hours worked, the answer to the question cannot be found in this table.

Answer:

2024-03-09 15:22:40.941 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021, we need to calculate the rate using the formula:

All Injury Frequency Rate = (Number of Medical Treatment Cases + Number of Lost Time Injuries) / Total hours worked * 1,000,000

From the table provided, we have the following relevant data for the year 2021:
- Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) = 102
- Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) = 1157

However, the table does not provide the total hours worked for the year 2021, which is essential for calculating the All Injury Frequency Rate. Without the total hours worked data, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be found in the provided markdown table.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, based on the information in the table, the correct answer to the question is '0.0'.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

To find the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021, we need to look at the row with the relevant information. In this case, it is row 184. 

In the FY21 column of row 184, we see a dash ("-") which indicates that the data for the Volume of Waste sent for Recycling (tonnes) – Food Waste Recovered in the year 2021 is missing or not available in the table. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the exact volume of food waste recovered in the year 2021.

In this table, the columns represent different fiscal years (FY21, FY22, FY23, FY24) and various environmental metrics or standards.

Since the question is specifically asking about the Area of forestland managed in 2021, we should focus on the FY21 column. However, upon examining the table, we can see that there is no direct mention of the Area of forestland managed in any of the rows.

The column headers do not explicitly mention forestland restoration or rehabilitation, so we need to carefully examine the content of each row.

The row that seems most likely to contain information related to forestland is "197 CDP Forest (Palm Oil/Soya/Beef/Timber)." In the FY21 column of this row, we see the values "C/D/C." Without further context or a key to interpret these values, it is not immediately clear if this information pertains to the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated in 2021.

Since the table does not provide explicit information on the Area of forestland restored and or rehabilitated in the year 2021, the answer is **no**.

Since the table does not have a specific column for the area of forestland with protected conservation status, we need to carefully examine the existing columns to see if this information is indirectly provided.

Based on the available columns, it seems that the table primarily focuses on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and sustainability metrics related to the company's operations.

2024-03-09 15:25:05.414 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: To find the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021, we need to look for relevant information in the table provided. Since the table does not explicitly mention the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee, we need to infer this information based on the available data.

The closest relevant information we have in the table is the "Percentage of Employees Trained in South Africa" for FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. However, this data only provides the percentage of employees trained, not the actual number of hours of training per employee.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot directly determine the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021.

In the provided table, there is no specific information related to the demographics of executive directors, let alone the breakdown by gender and race. The table mainly focuses on questions related to ESG/Sustainability, board diversity policies, and standards.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table, we cannot determine the percentage of Black female executive directors as a % of all directors in the year 2021.

The first column of the table contains information related to disclosing the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, including disclosing greenhouse gas emissions and related risks, as well as describing targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities.

The second column of the table provides references for the information mentioned in the first column, such as specific pages in the ESG databook and ESG Performance summary report.

Based on the information in the table, we can see that the table does not directly provide the description of environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021.

The first column of the table seems to contain information related to the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, including targets used to manage these risks and opportunities. However, the specific information about environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned in this column.

The second column appears to provide references related to the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities. In this case, the reference mentioned is the "ESG Performance summary report page 12." This reference may contain more detailed information about the organization's environmental management policies and practices for active sites in the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the answer to the question cannot be directly found in the table itself. However, the reference provided in the second column may lead to the relevant information.

Specifically, we should focus on the columns related to the years (FY23, FY22, FY21, FY20) and the corresponding row that may contain details about the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery.

In this table, there is no direct mention of the management system for prevention of corruption and bribery throughout the value chain. The closest relevant information is in row 48, which discusses auditing suppliers and contractors for ESG compliance, including human rights.

In this table, the relevant columns for our analysis are the FY21 column and the COMMENTS column. The FY21 column contains the data for the fiscal year 2021, which is the year we are interested in. The COMMENTS column may provide additional context or explanations related to the data.

Looking at the table, we can see that there are entries for "Number of Lost Time Injuries" and "Total Number of Recordable Injuries" for FY21. These numbers can give us insights into the management of accident and safety risks in that year.

Additionally, the COMMENTS column may contain further details or footnotes that could elaborate on the safety performance and management practices in FY21.

Therefore, based on the information available in the markdown table, it is possible to find the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021.
