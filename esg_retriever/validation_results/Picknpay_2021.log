The specific question asks for the Board meeting attendance rate in the year 2021. However, the provided markdown table does not contain any information related to Board meeting attendance rates. The table primarily focuses on ESG/Sustainability data, absenteeism, GRI standards, SASB standards, JSE, and comments. Since there is no mention of Board meeting attendance rates in the table, the answer to the specific question cannot be found within this context.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:12:28.611 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the ESG/Sustainability Databook, specifically for the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) row, we can see that the values provided for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20 are 0, 0, 0, and 0 respectively. This indicates that the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) was 0.0 for all these years, including 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021 was indeed 0.0.

The specific question is asking for the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021. In the provided markdown table, under the "FY21" column, it states that the total number of environmental incidents (Level 1, 2, and/or 3) was 0 for the year 2021. Since the table explicitly states that the number of incidents was 0, we can directly retrieve the answer to the question from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the specific question can be found in the provided markdown table.

year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:13:07.818 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the markdown table provided, the value for the number of environmental incidents in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The table only shows '0' for all the years including 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:13:16.664 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The table provides the percentage of board members who are women for different fiscal years, including 2021. However, it only gives the percentage (33.3% for FY21) and not the exact number of female board members in the year 2021. To determine the exact number of female board members in 2021, you would need additional information such as the total number of board members. Since the table does not provide this specific information, the exact number of female board members in 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Are you sure that '33.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of female board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:13:44.632 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:376 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the percentage of board members who are women is stated as 33.3%. This value corresponds to the year in question, which is 2021. Therefore, '33.3%' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of female board members in the year 2021?".

For the second table, the percentage of board members who are women is not explicitly provided for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage for that year from this table.

In the provided markdown table, there are entries for "Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion" and "Spend on Black-owned SMMEs in Rand billion" for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. 

The table does provide the information for the spend on Black Women-owned Businesses and Black-owned SMMEs for the year 2021, which is 5.2 billion Rand and 2.6 billion Rand respectively. However, it does not explicitly state the specific procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021. The table only provides the total spend on these categories without specifying the exact procurement from suppliers meeting the criteria mentioned in the question.

Are you sure that '12.9' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).

The specific question asks for the Total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021. The markdown table provided does not contain any information related to the total local/BBBEE procurement for the year 2021. The table mainly highlights the Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) program, sustainable practices of suppliers, and the number of SMMEs using Pick n Pay's finance program. Since there is no mention of the total local/BBBEE procurement in the table, the answer to the specific question cannot be found in the given context.

The specific question asks for the Total Recordable Injury Incidence Rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021. The table provided only includes data for the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. The TRIFR is not the same as the TRIIR. The TRIIR is a measure of the number of recordable injuries per 100 full-time employees in a given period, while the TRIFR is the number of recordable injuries per 1 million hours worked.

Since the table does not contain the TRIIR for the year 2021, the answer to the specific question cannot be found in the provided context.

Answer:

Moving on to the second table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is explicitly stated as '5'. Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, '5.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of executive board members in the year 2021.

2024-03-09 18:15:27.501 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021. In the provided markdown table, there are two relevant rows:

1. Average Length of Non-Executive Director Service (in years)

Both rows provide the average length of service for directors but do not specify the number of years per board member in the year 2021.

Therefore, the exact answer to the question "What was the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021?" cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Please note that the table provides averages for all directors, not individual board members, so the specific number of years per board member in 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Are you sure that '66.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of non-executive board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:16:16.767 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

The table provided does not contain a specific row or column that directly states the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021. The table mainly focuses on different aspects related to board governance, such as the independence of the board chairman and the existence of a policy on board conflicts of interest. Without a specific row or column detailing the percentage of independent board members in 2021, the answer to the question cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

Therefore, the answer is no.

The table only provides the number of board members deemed 'Independent' for each fiscal year but does not give the total number of board members for each year.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.
The answer, if it exists, should be specific to the question - not just a value related to the question.
No calculations will be required to answer the question - the answer, if it exists, will be directly retrievable from the context.
If the answer is not directly retrievable from the context, your conclusion should be 'no'.
Think step by step, and explain your reasoning.
Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.
Before concluding 'yes', please double-check that the answer to the EXACT question is directly available in the context.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:16:26.884 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: The specific question is asking for the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021. However, the provided markdown table does not contain any information related to Advisory fees or the income statement. The table only includes details about the financial auditor, auditor remuneration percentages, and some standards, but it does not mention anything about Advisory fees specifically for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-09 18:20:25.122 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:316 - Filtering context response: No.

Explanation:
The specific question asks for the Board members under 30 in the year 2021. The provided markdown table does not contain any information related to the age or specific demographics of the Board members. The table primarily focuses on ESG/Sustainability metrics, standards, and policies. Since there is no mention of the age of Board members in the table, the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the context.
