Are you sure that '112.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:34.356 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, there is no specific information provided for the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned for the year 2021. The values mentioned in the table are related to the number of entrepreneurs enrolled in a program and the number of employees providing mentorship, not procurement spend.

Moving on to the second table, there is also no mention of the BBBEE procurement spend for the year 2021. The information in this table pertains to the presence of a publicly available human rights policy and the inclusion of ESG into service level agreements with suppliers.

Lastly, in the third table, the focus is on whether the company includes ESG into service level agreements with suppliers and whether the company formally audits suppliers and contractors for ESG compliance. Again, there is no direct mention of the BBBEE procurement spend for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '112.0' is not the correct answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:41.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is not explicitly provided. The value for FIFR in 2021 is missing in this table.

In the second table for the year 2021, the FIFR is explicitly stated as '0'.

In the third table for the year 2021, the FIFR is not explicitly provided. The value for FIFR in 2021 is missing in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021?" is '0' only in the second table.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:47.816 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 are not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is marked as a dash ("-"), indicating that the data is not available for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021.

2024-03-06 23:26:55.112 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for each year but does not calculate the LTIFR. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that the LTIFR in the year 2021 was 0.74.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is provided as 0, but this is not the same as the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). The LTIFR specifically relates to lost time injuries, while the FIFR relates to fatalities. Therefore, we cannot use the FIFR value to determine the LTIFR for the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) is provided, but the LTIFR is not explicitly calculated or provided. Therefore, we cannot determine that the LTIFR in the year 2021 was 0.74 based on the information in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot conclusively determine that the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021 was 0.74.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '102.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs, i.e. injuries on duty leading to medical treatment, but no lost days) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:26:57.792 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) is listed as 102. However, it is important to note that the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the second table, so we cannot confirm if it is indeed 102 for that year. 

In the third table, the value for MTCs in 2021 is again listed as 102. Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can conclude that the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) in the year 2021 is 102.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:02.880 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is explicitly stated as '0'. Therefore, based on this table, the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was indeed '0'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" is explicitly stated as '0'. This is not the same as the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact, so we cannot use this value to answer the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:06.350 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is indicated as '0'. This means that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this specific table.

In the second table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is also indicated as '0'. This confirms that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table for the year 2021, the Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities is provided, but the specific number of Fatalities is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the exact number of work-related fatalities for the year 2021 from this table alone.

Based on the information provided in the tables for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021?" is 'No'.

Are you sure that '53.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:24.323 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first markdown table, the value for "Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021" is not explicitly provided. The table only shows the percentage of Pick n Pay Clothing sourced from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and locally sourced for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. Since the specific procurement value for the year 2021 is not mentioned in the table, we cannot confirm that '53.4' is the correct answer.

For the second and third markdown tables, the information related to the procurement from majority black-owned or black women-owned suppliers is not provided at all. The tables highlight other aspects of Pick n Pay's operations and sustainability practices but do not mention the specific procurement value for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, we cannot confirm that '53.4' is the correct answer to the question regarding procurement from majority black-owned or black women-owned suppliers in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '15.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment, development, support of housing, sanitation, energy, telecoms and other community-related needs (consolidated CSI Spend) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:27.145 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the tables provided, we can see that the spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment, development, support of housing, sanitation, energy, telecoms, and other community-related needs is not explicitly mentioned for the year 2021 in any of the tables. The closest values we have are for specific categories like education, environmental management projects, basic needs & social development, and skills development.

Therefore, based on the information available in the tables, we cannot confirm that the spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment in the year 2021 was 15.8.

Are you sure that '1006000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total water consumed in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

Are you sure that '53.4' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:36.500 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated. The value of R53.4 billion is mentioned for the last financial year, but it is not specified whether this amount specifically refers to the year 2021.

Moving on to the second table, the percentage of Pick n Pay Clothing locally sourced is provided for each year, but there is no mention of the total local/BBBEE procurement for the year 2021.

In the third table, the row for Food Safety does not provide any information on the total local/BBBEE procurement for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be definitively concluded that the total local/BBBEE procurement in the year 2021 was R53.4 billion.

Are you sure that '2810872.8' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:40.747 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules is given as '2.81087e+06'. This value does not match '2810872.80'.

In the second table, for the year 2021, the Total Direct and Indirect (i.e., Electricity) Energy Consumption in Gigajoules is not provided ('–').

In the third table, for the year 2021, the Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules is given as '2810872.80'. This value matches '2810872.80'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, '2810872.80' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021?".

Are you sure that '2.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total recordable injury incedence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:46.826 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is listed as 2.5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" is '2.5'.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is listed as 0. This does not provide information about the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) for the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is listed as 2.5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" is '2.5'.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'yes'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:51.321 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. **Table 1**:
   - There is no specific row for community health & social welfare initiatives in 2021.
   - The values provided are for CSI/SED Spend on Basic Needs & Social Development and CSI/SED Spend on Education.
   - The total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives in 2021 is not explicitly stated in this table.

2. **Table 2**:
   - There is a row for Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures in 2021.
   - The value for this row in 2021 is 41.3 Rand Million.
   - This value does not represent the total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excl. infrastructure investments.

3. **Table 3**:
   - There is no specific row for community health & social welfare initiatives in 2021.
   - The values provided are for spend on Climate Change Mitigation and CDP Climate.
   - The total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives in 2021 is not explicitly stated in this table.

Based on the analysis of the tables, the total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excl. infrastructure investments in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in any of the tables. Therefore, the answer to the question is **no**.

Are you sure that '41.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Rand Million Value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:27:58.244 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first markdown table:

|                                                                |   FY23 |   FY22 |   FY21 |

The Rand million value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation is not explicitly provided in this table for the year 2021.

Moving on to the second markdown table:

The Rand million value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation is not provided in this table for the year 2021.

Lastly, looking at the third markdown table:

|                                                                             | FY23   | FY22   | FY21   |

The Rand million value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation is not mentioned in this table for the year 2021 either.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the markdown tables, the answer to the question "What was the Rand Million Value of distributions on behalf of Feed the Nation in the year 2021?" is **no**.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:12.056 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for the percentage of non-executive board members, not the actual number. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of non-executive board members in 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The values given are for the number of executive and independent board members, not the non-executive board members. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of non-executive board members in 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 10. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of non-executive board members in the year 2021?" based on this table is '10'.

Conclusion: No, '10.0' is not the correct answer based on the information provided in all three tables.

Are you sure that '59.2' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:14.800 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the row for the "Average Age of Directors" in the year 2021 shows a value of 59.2 years. This value represents the average age of directors in that year, not the number of years on the Board per Board Member. Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:18.709 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given in the table are for the Number of New Stores Opened and Total Store Floorspace for different years, but the specific number of retail locations in 2021 is not mentioned.

Moving on to the second table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is also not explicitly stated. The table provides data for the Number of Company-owned Stores and Number of Franchise stores for different years, but the exact number of retail locations in 2021 is not given.

In the third table, the Number of retail locations in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 61 for the Number of Associate-owned Stores. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of retail locations in the year 2021?" based on the third table is '61'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:23.187 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for "FY21" states "0" for the Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances.
- Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021?" based on this table is "0".

For the second table:
- The row for "FY21" also states "0" for the Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances.
- Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021?" based on this table is also "0".

For the third table:
- The row for "FY21" does not explicitly state the value for the Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances.
- Therefore, based on this table, we cannot determine the exact value for the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the answer to the question for the first two tables is "0", but for the third table, the answer is not explicitly stated.

Are you sure that '13.6' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Carbon Intensity: Average Volume of Carbon Emissions per Person Hour Worked (tonnes CO2 e/PHW) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:25.927 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: In the first table, for the year 2021, the Carbon Intensity value is not explicitly provided. The values given are 14.8 for FY23, 15.0 for FY22, and 13.3 for FY20. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm that '13.6' is the correct answer for the Carbon Intensity in 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '2.2' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:43.685 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Advisory fees as per income statement for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for FY21.

In the second table, the Advisory fees as per income statement for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. Similar to the first table, the values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is left blank.

In the third table, the Advisory fees as per income statement for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided either. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but there is no specific value mentioned for FY21.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the Advisory fees as per income statement for the year 2021. 

No.

Are you sure that '2.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the All Inury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:50.336 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value provided for the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is '2.5'. This value represents the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021, not the All Injury Frequency Rate (Injuries/1m hrs worked). Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine the All Injury Frequency Rate for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:28:55.416 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, there is no specific row that provides the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot determine that the amount was '15.0' for the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, there is also no specific row that provides the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table as well, we cannot determine that the amount was '15.0' for the year 2021.

In the third table, there is a row related to Governance, but it does not provide information on the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot confirm that '15.0' was the correct answer for the Amount of assets under management by asset class that employ governance issues in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '1.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:02.980 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 states "1.5" as the value for "Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects."
- There is no specific mention of assets under management or integration of environmental issues in this row for the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 states "3.3" as the value for "Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Skills Development, including Adult Basic Education & Training (ABET)."
- There is no specific mention of assets under management or integration of environmental issues in this row for the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the second table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 states "41.3" as the value for "Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures."
- There is no specific mention of assets under management or integration of environmental issues in this row for the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the third table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ integration of environmental issues in the year 2021.

For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:11.220 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues is not explicitly provided. The only value mentioned for 2021 in this table is '41.3', which corresponds to the value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table, we cannot determine the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value of CSI/SED Spend as a Percentage of Total Revenue Generated is provided as '0.043%'. This table does not mention the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues for the year 2021.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value of CSI/SED Spend on Basic Needs & Social Development, including Nutrition and/or Feeding Programmes is provided as '14.3'. The value of CSI/SED Spend on Education is provided as '11.2'. However, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues is not explicitly mentioned for the year 2021 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the three tables, the amount of assets under management by asset class that employ social issues in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated.

Are you sure that '1.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ sustainability themed investing in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:13.511 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row that corresponds to the question about the amount of assets under management that employ sustainability themed investing is not explicitly provided. The values in that row are related to the Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects, not assets under management.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table for the year 2021, we cannot determine that "1.5" is the correct answer to the question.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:21.552 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 is related to "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances".
- The value provided for FY21 is '0', indicating that there were no fines or non-compliances in that year.
- There is no specific mention of the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 is related to "Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings (including fines) due to fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anti-competitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice or violations of other industry laws or regulations".
- The value provided for FY21 is '0', indicating that there were no losses resulting from legal proceedings in that year.
- There is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 is related to "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances".
- The value provided for FY21 is '0', indicating that there were no fines or non-compliances in that year.
- There is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Based on the information provided in the tables, the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '0.0' in any of the tables. Therefore, the correct answer is 'No'.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:29.940 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values are given for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact attendance rate for the year 2021 based on the information provided in the table.

For the second table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100.0%. Therefore, we can confidently say that the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is 100.0%.

For the third table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 100.0%. Therefore, we can confidently say that the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is 100.0%.

Conclusion: Yes

Are you sure that '1157.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Average number hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

The table does not provide the specific value for the average number of hours of health, safety, and emergency response training for full-time employees in the year 2021. The table only includes information on injuries and recordable incidents for that year.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '54.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurment spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:41.955 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the BBBEE procurement spend is not explicitly mentioned for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value from this table.

In the second table, the BBBEE procurement spend for the year 2021 is stated as 54.5 billion rand.

In the third table, the BBBEE procurement spend for the year 2021 is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question is 'No', as the value of 54.5 billion rand is not explicitly stated as the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 in any of the tables.

Are you sure that '29.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the B-BBEE Scorecard Level in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer."?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:29:45.749 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, there is no specific information provided about the B-BBEE Scorecard Level. The value '29.0' is not mentioned in this table for the year 2021.

In the second table, for the year 2021, again there is no mention of the B-BBEE Scorecard Level. The value '29.0' is not present in this table for the year 2021.

Moving on to the third table, for the year 2021, there is no reference to the B-BBEE Scorecard Level. The value '29.0' is not indicated in this table for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the B-BBEE Scorecard Level for the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '29.0'. 

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members over 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Are you sure that '4.27' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:30:23.865 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row "200 CSI Spend as a Percentage of Net Profit after Tax (NPAT)" shows a value of 4.27%. This value represents the percentage of CSI spend in relation to net profit after tax for the year 2021. 

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, the cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is indeed 4.27%.

Yes

2024-03-06 23:30:23.865 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:convert_unit:366 - Unit conversion prompt:

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 4.27 Percentage in rand?

Are you sure that '41.321' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:30:30.820 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for the year 2021 in the row "Rand million value of ESG investment, inclusive of CSI and SED" is 41.3, not 41.321.

In the second table, there is no specific value provided for the year 2021 in the row "198 Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures". Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for the year 2021 from this table.

In the third table, the value for the year 2021 in the row "204 Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend in Environmental Management Projects" is 1.5, not 41.321.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question regarding the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as 41.321.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '30.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Description of approach to informing customers about products and services in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:30:33.728 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row corresponding to the "Description of approach to informing customers about products and services" is not explicitly provided. The values mentioned in the table are related to the Number of Employees Providing Enterprise and Supplier Development Mentorship and the Percentage of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil in Pick n Pay Branded Products.

Therefore, based on the information available in the table for the year 2021, it is not possible to determine that '30.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the description of the approach to informing customers about products and services.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

The value '1259' corresponds to the total number of recordable injuries in the year 2021. This value does not directly provide information on the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021. Therefore, based on the provided table, it cannot be conclusively stated that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the discussion of management of accident and safety risks in 2021.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-06 23:30:50.248 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is not explicitly providing information on the "Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products."
- The value '0.0' is not mentioned in the table for the year 2021 in relation to this question.

For the second table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 is explicitly stating that the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is 0 for the year 2021.
- However, this specific value does not directly address the question about the "Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products."

For the third table:
- The row corresponding to the year 2021 does not provide information on the "Discussion of processes to assess and manage risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products."
- The value '0.0' is not mentioned in the table for the year 2021 in relation to this question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the answer is **no**.
