Are you sure that '7.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifyimg Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51 black owned in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:22.042 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black owned in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value of '7.7' mentioned in the table corresponds to the spend on Black-owned Businesses, not specifically on EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black owned.

Moving on to the second table, the spend on Black-owned Businesses is provided for the year 2021 as 7.7 Rand billion. However, this value does not specifically indicate the spend on EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black owned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be confirmed that '7.7' is the correct answer to the question regarding the BBBEE procurement spend from EMEs, QSEs, and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black owned in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:27.885 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine the exact FIFR for that year based on the information given in this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is explicitly stated as '0'. Therefore, the FIFR for the year 2021 in this table is indeed '0'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is not explicitly provided. The value for FY21 is missing in the table, so we cannot determine the exact FIFR for that year based on the information given in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 is '0' in the second table, but it is not explicitly stated in the first and third tables.

Are you sure that '7.1' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:34.067 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '7.1' is given for FY23, but there is no data for FY21 in this table.

In the second table, the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The value '7.1' is given for FY22, but there is no data for FY21 in this table.

In the third table, the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '7.1' is given for FY20, but there is no data for FY21 in this table.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the GHG Scope 2 emissions for the year 2021.

Are you sure that '2.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:41.144 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) value is not explicitly provided. The values given are 2.25 for FY23, 2.54 for FY22, and 3.07 for FY20. Since there is no specific value mentioned for FY21, we cannot definitively say that '2.3' is the correct answer for the LTIFR in the year 2021 based on this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the LTIFR value is also not explicitly provided. The values given are 1214 for Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and 1259 for Total Number of Recordable Injuries. Again, without a specific LTIFR value for FY21, we cannot confirm that '2.3' is the correct answer for the LTIFR in the year 2021 based on this table.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot determine the exact Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for the year 2021. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:44.079 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) is listed as 102. However, it is important to note that the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the second table, so we cannot confirm if it is indeed 102 for that year. 

In the third table, the value for MTCs in 2021 is again listed as 102. Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can conclude that the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) in the year 2021 is 102.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:48.406 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0.0' based on the information given in this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" is explicitly stated as '0'. Therefore, based on this table, we can conclude that the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the value for the "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" is explicitly stated as '0'. This is not the same metric as the "Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" but it does provide some insight into the environmental performance for that year.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the second table, the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 was '0'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:52.406 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is indicated as '0'. This means that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this specific table.

In the second table for the year 2021, the Number of Fatalities is also indicated as '0'. This confirms that there were no work-related fatalities reported for the year 2021 in this table as well.

Lastly, in the third table for the year 2021, the Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities is provided as '1259', but the specific number of Fatalities is not explicitly stated. Therefore, based on the information provided in this table alone, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of work-related fatalities for the year 2021.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021?" is '0' for the first two tables, but it is not explicitly stated in the third table.

Are you sure that '5.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of female board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:00:56.010 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Number of female board members in the year 2021 is 5.
- Therefore, '5.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of female board members in the year 2021?"

For the second table:
- The Number of female board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- Therefore, we cannot determine if '5.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

For the third table:
- The Number of female board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided.
- Therefore, we cannot determine if '5.0' is the correct answer to the question for this table.

Conclusion: 
- Based on the information provided in the first table, '5.0' is the correct answer to the question for that specific table.
- For the other tables, we do not have the explicit information to confirm if '5.0' is the correct answer.
- Yes

Are you sure that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:04.170 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '1259' corresponds to the Total Number of Recordable Injuries for that year, which includes MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries specifically for the year 2021 in this table.

For the second table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as '1259'. Therefore, in this table, '1259.0' is indeed the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries specifically for the year 2021.

For the third table, the Number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The value '102' corresponds to the Number of Medical Treatment Cases for that year, not the total number of occupational injuries. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that '1259.0' is the correct answer to the question regarding the Number of occupational injuries specifically for the year 2021 in this table.

It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:08.242 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the percentage of female board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is missing.

In the second table, the percentage of female board members in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 33.3%. Therefore, '33.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of female board members in the year 2021?".

In the third table, the percentage of female board members in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is missing.

So, based on the information provided in the tables, '33.3' is the correct answer to the question.

Are you sure that '1.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:12.571 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The only information related to renewable energy in this table is the Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated, but this does not directly give the percentage of renewable energy in the total consumption.

For the second table, the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. Similar to the first table, the only information related to renewable energy is the Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated, which does not give the percentage of renewable energy in the total consumption.

For the third table, the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021 is explicitly provided as 1.0%. This indicates that 1.0% of the electricity consumed in the year 2021 was self-generated renewable energy.

Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:16.868 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Row for "127 Spend on Black-owned Businesses in Rand billion":
     - FY21 value: 7.7
   - Row for "128 Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion":
     - FY21 value: 5.2

2. Table 2:
   - Row for "128 Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion":
     - FY21 value: 5.2
   - Row for "129 Spend on Black-owned SMMEs in Rand billion":
     - FY21 value: 2.6

3. Table 3:
   - Row for "114 Percentage of Pick n Pay Clothing Suppliers Registered on SEDEX":
     - FY21 value: 77%
   - Row for "115 Percentage of Pick n Pay Clothing Sourced from the Southern African Development Community (SADC)":
     - FY21 value: 43%

Based on the analysis of the tables, the value of "12.9" is not explicitly provided for the Procurement from suppliers that are majority black-owned or 30% or more black women-owned in the year 2021 in any of the tables.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '41.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total expenditure on green investments in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:25.443 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The Total expenditure on green investments in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values given are for Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures, not specifically green investments.

For the second table:
- The Total expenditure on green investments in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values given are for Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) and Enterprise Development (ED) expenditures, not specifically green investments.

For the third table:
- The Total expenditure on green investments in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the table. The values given are for Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules, not for green investments.

Conclusion: No, the correct answer is not '41.3' for the Total expenditure on green investments in the year 2021 in any of the tables.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:29.805 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given in the table are for Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated and Total Volume of Electricity Consumed, but the breakdown of renewable fuels consumed is not specified.

Moving on to the second table, the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021 is also not explicitly stated. The values given are for Total Indirect Energy Consumption and Total Direct and Indirect Energy Consumption, but the specific amount of energy from renewable fuels consumed is not mentioned.

Lastly, in the third table, the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021 is not directly given. The table provides data for Total Volume of Electricity Purchased and Total Volume of Electricity Self-Generated, but it does not break down the consumption of renewable fuels separately.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it cannot be confirmed that '780798.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021?".

Are you sure that '1006000.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total water consumed in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:32.659 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is stated as '1.006e+06', which is equivalent to 1,006,000 kilolitres.

In the second table, the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021 is stated as '1006000', which is also equivalent to 1,006,000 kilolitres.

In the third table, there is no explicit value provided for the total volume of water consumed in the year 2021.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.
Please return a single number as your answer. Do not elaborate or give
any context.

What is 54.5 rand billion in rand?

Are you sure that '4594.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:40.734 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of audits for the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits for the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 4594. This means that the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits in the year 2021?" based on this table is '4594'.

In the third table, the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of audits for the year 2021 from this table.

So, the correct answer to the question based on the second table is '4594.0'.

Are you sure that '2.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total recordable injury incedence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:45.631 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the year 2021 is stated as '2.5'. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" based on this table is '2.5'.

Looking at the second table, the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the year 2021 is also stated as '2.5'. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021?" based on this table is also '2.5'.

Looking at the third table, the Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) for the year 2021 based on this table.

So, based on the information provided in the first two tables, the Total recordable injury incidence rate (TRIIR) in the year 2021 is '2.5'. 

Conclusion: Yes

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:01:49.205 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021 to determine the Total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excluding infrastructure investments:

1. **Table 1**:
   - No specific row mentions the Total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives for the year 2021.
   
2. **Table 2**:
   - No specific row mentions the Total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives for the year 2021.
   
3. **Table 3**:
   - The row "198 Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures" provides the closest information, but it does not specify the breakdown for community health & social welfare initiatives.
   
Based on the information provided in the tables, there is no explicit mention of the Total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excluding infrastructure investments for the year 2021. Therefore, we cannot confirm that '25.5' is the correct answer.

The values given are for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of executive board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Looking at the second table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is explicitly stated as 5. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of executive board members in the year 2021?" based on this table is '5'.

Looking at the third table for the year 2021, the Number of executive board members is not explicitly provided. The values given are for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of executive board members for the year 2021 from this table.

Are you sure that '7.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Number of independent board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:02.776 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- In the FY21 row, the Number of independent board members is stated as 7.
- Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of independent board members in the year 2021?" is '7'.

For the second table:
- In the FY21 row, the Number of independent board members is not explicitly stated.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of independent board members in the year 2021 from this table.

For the third table:
- In the FY21 row, the Number of independent board members is not explicitly stated.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of independent board members in the year 2021 from this table.

Conclusion: 
- Yes, '7.0' is the correct answer based on the information provided in the first table.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:12.066 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the number of retail locations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20, but the specific number for 2021 is missing.

In the second table, the number of retail locations in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 1991.

In the third table, the number of retail locations in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20, but the specific number for 2021 is missing.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Number of retail locations in the year 2021?" is '1991.0' as stated in the second table.

Are you sure that '69505.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Total External carbon tax paid in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:17.258 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the value provided for "Rand Value of Carbon Tax Paid" is 69505. This value corresponds to the total external carbon tax paid in the year 2021 according to the table.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Total External carbon tax paid in the year 2021?" based on the information in the first table is '69505'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:20.195 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for the Carbon Intensity in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values given are for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but there is no specific value mentioned for FY21.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the first table, we cannot confirm that '13.6' is the correct answer for the Carbon Intensity in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '7.75' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:23.361 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the value for "Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW)" in the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values for FY23, FY22, and FY20 are given, but FY21 is missing.

Moving on to the second table, the value for the same metric in the year 2021 is explicitly stated as 7.75.

In the third table, the value for the metric in the year 2021 is not provided. The values for FY23 and FY22 are given, but FY21 is represented as a dash "-".

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, the correct answer to the question "What was the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021?" is 'yes'.

Are you sure that '16648.5' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:47.175 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the second markdown table, the row corresponding to the year 2021 states "16648.5" as the "Rand Million Value of Current Assets - Total." This value does not directly correspond to the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ governance issues" as mentioned in the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, it is not explicitly stated that "16648.5" is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of assets under management that employ governance issues in the year 2021.

Conclusion: No

Are you sure that '41.3' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:02:53.600 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the value provided is 41.3 for "Rand Million Value of Corporate Social Investment (CSI)/Socio-economic Development (SED) expenditures." This value does not correspond to the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues." Therefore, the value of 41.3 in this table does not answer the question regarding assets under management.

Looking at the second table, for the year 2021, the value provided is "0" for "Total number and/or percentage of operations that have undergone a human rights assessment." This table does not provide information related to assets under management or asset classes. 

In the third table, for the year 2021, the value provided is not applicable (denoted by "-") for "CSI/SED and Enterprise Development (ED) Expenditures." This table also does not provide information related to assets under management or asset classes.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, none of the values directly answer the question about the "Amount of assets under management, by asset class, that employ social issues in the year 2021."

Conclusion: No.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:02.255 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table:
- The row for the year 2021 states "0" for the Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings.
- There is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we cannot definitively say that "0.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the second table:
- The row for the year 2021 also states "0" for the Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings.
- There is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Similar to the first table, based on the information provided in this table, we cannot definitively say that "0.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

For the third table:
- The row for the year 2021 states "0" for the Total Number of Environmental Incidents and "0" for the Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances.
- There is no specific mention of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in this table, we cannot definitively say that "0.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the tables, we cannot confirm that "0.0" is the correct answer to the question regarding the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021.

Are you sure that '100.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:09.876 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided. The values are given for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact attendance rate for the year 2021 from this table.

In the second table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is given as 100.0%. So, in this case, we can confidently say that the attendance rate for the year 2021 is 100.0%.

In the third table, the Audit committee meeting attendance rate for the year 2021 is also not explicitly provided. The values are given for FY23, FY22, and FY20, but FY21 is missing. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact attendance rate for the year 2021 from this table.

So, the answer is 'No'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:20.419 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table, in the year 2021, the number of Board members between 30 - 50 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine if the correct answer is '0.0' based on the information given in this table.

For the second table, in the year 2021, the number of Board members between 30 - 50 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine if the correct answer is '0.0' based on the information given in this table.

For the third table, in the year 2021, the number of Board members between 30 - 50 is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine if the correct answer is '0.0' based on the information given in this table.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the three tables, we cannot definitively say that the number of Board members between 30 - 50 in the year 2021 is '0.0'.

Are you sure that '1231.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:27.687 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Let's analyze each table individually for the year 2021:

1. Table 1:
   - Row for FY21: Rand Million Value of Dividends Paid to Shareholders = 876
   - Row for FY21: Rand Million Value of Retained Earnings = 4573.5

2. Table 2:
   - Row for FY21: Rand Million Value of Retained Earnings = 4573.5
   - Row for FY21: Ratio of Payments to Employees relative to Dividends paid to Shareholders = 9.1

3. Table 3:
   - Row for FY21: Rand Million Value of Dividends Paid to Shareholders = 876
   - Row for FY21: Rand Million Value of Payments to Providers of Capital = 1231

Based on the information provided in the tables, the Cost relating to acquisition per income statement in the year 2021 is not explicitly stated as '1231.0' in any of the tables. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:38.708 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: For the first table regarding human rights assessment in the year 2021, the value provided is '0', not '0.0'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operation in areas of conflict in the year 2021?" is '0'.

For the second table regarding climate-related risks and opportunities in the year 2021, there is no explicit value provided for the described processes. Therefore, the answer to the question is not explicitly stated in the context.

Conclusion: 
- For the first table: Yes
- For the second table: No

Are you sure that '1157.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-08 23:03:44.555 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:307 - Validation response: Looking at the table for the year 2021:

| 100 Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs and fatalities                      |   1490 |   1622 |   1259 |   1535 | 403-9a          |                  |       |                 |

The value '1157' corresponds to the total number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) in the year 2021. This does not directly answer the question about the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks in 2021. The table does not provide explicit information on the discussion of management of accident and safety risks and long-term health and safety risks for the year 2021.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, the correct answer is 'No'.
