The table includes a specific row for "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" with the corresponding data for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the context.

The table includes a specific row for "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" with the corresponding data for the years 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The value for the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021 is explicitly stated in the table as 1.331. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

The table includes the Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors, which is the number of LTIs per 200,000 person hours worked.

The LTIFR provided in the table is specific to both employees and contractors, which means it already includes the data for both groups. The LTIFR is a measure of the frequency of lost time injuries, which is a component of the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR).

Given that the LTIFR includes data for both employees and contractors, we can consider it as a part of the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for the combined group. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

However, the table does not directly provide information on the attendance of Board and Committee meetings for each year.

The answer to the specific question "What was the Energy efficiency: total direct and indirect energy consumed per ton of sugar produced in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table. The table includes a specific indicator for "Energy efficiency: total direct and indirect energy consumed per ton of sugar produced" with the unit of measure in GJ/t for the year 2021.

The table primarily contains details about services provided by Deloitte & Touche, internal audit arrangements, and B-BBEE contributor level.

Since there is no mention of advisory fees or income statement figures in the table, the specific question "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021?" cannot be directly answered based on the information provided.

However, the table only includes indicators related to auditor remuneration and the length of the current auditor's service.

The indicators in the table do not directly provide information on the advisory fees as per the income statement for the year 2021. The table focuses on auditor remuneration and the length of the current auditor's service, which are different from advisory fees.

Without a specific indicator related to advisory fees in the table, we cannot determine the exact amount of advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Advisory fees as per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes a section for "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" but does not specify the breakdown of different pollutants within this category.

The table only provides information on carbon emissions as a whole under Scope 1, without a specific mention of CO emissions. Without a separate entry for CO emissions or a breakdown of pollutants within the carbon emissions category, we cannot determine the specific amount of CO emissions in the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table does not provide any data on CO emissions specifically. It mentions carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) for LPG and acetylene, which are different pollutants from CO. Without a direct mention of CO emissions in the table, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO in the year 2021 from the given information.

However, this data does not specify the emissions of CO (carbon monoxide) specifically.

The data provided in the table is related to carbon emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent, not specifically CO emissions. Carbon emissions can include various compounds, and without a specific breakdown for CO emissions, we cannot determine the exact amount of CO emissions in the year 2021 from the given table.
