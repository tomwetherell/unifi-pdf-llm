The indicator provided in the table is "Electricity efficiency: electricity consumed per ton of sugar produced," which specifically addresses electricity consumption. However, the question is asking for the total direct and indirect energy consumed per ton of sugar produced, which may include other forms of energy consumption beyond just electricity.

Answer:

2024-03-11 21:21:03.821 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:_filter_context_documents:284 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO specifically in the year 2021, we need to look for the data related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. The table includes a category for "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" but does not specify the breakdown of different pollutants within this category.

While the table provides the total carbon emissions for Scope 1 in various years, it does not explicitly mention the amount of CO emissions for the year 2021. Without a specific value for CO emissions in 2021, we cannot determine the exact amount of CO emissions from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-11 21:21:18.250 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:_filter_context_documents:284 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to NOx emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on carbon emissions, specifically carbon emissions under Scope 1.

Since the table does not provide any data or information related to NOx emissions, we cannot directly retrieve the air emissions of NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021 from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (2) NOx (excluding N2O) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.
