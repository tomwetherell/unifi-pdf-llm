The table includes a specific row for "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" with the corresponding data for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the context.

The table includes a specific row for "Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) - employees and contractors" with the corresponding data for the years 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The value for the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021 is explicitly stated in the table as 1.331. Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) – employees and contractors in the year 2021?" can be directly found in the provided markdown table.

Conclusion: yes
2024-03-13 22:15:13.605 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:302 - Filtering context conclusion: yes
2024-03-13 22:15:14.240 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:299 - Filtering context response: To find the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for employees and contractors, which is the number of Lost Time Injuries per 200,000 person hours worked.

The LTIFR provided in the table is specific to Lost Time Injuries and does not directly give the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for both employees and contractors. The TIFR would typically include all types of injuries, not just Lost Time Injuries.

Since the table only provides data on the LTIFR and not the TIFR, we cannot directly retrieve the Total injury frequency rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors in the year 2021 from the context.

The table primarily contains details about the review of internal controls, risk review, B-BBEE contributor level, and verification services provided by Deloitte & Touche and Internal Audit (co-sourced with KPMG).

Since there is no mention of advisory fees or income statement figures in the table, the specific question regarding the advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021 cannot be directly answered from the context.

The indicators in the table do not directly provide information on advisory fees. The "Auditor Remuneration" indicator specifically mentions the percentage of non-audit fees paid to auditors, which is different from advisory fees. Additionally, the "Length of current auditor's service" indicator is not related to advisory fees at all.

Answer:

2024-03-13 22:15:46.003 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:299 - Filtering context response: To find the air emissions of CO (Carbon Monoxide) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific entry related to CO emissions in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information on carbon emissions in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) for LPG and Acetylene.

The table does not provide specific data on CO emissions. It only mentions emissions related to LPG and Acetylene, which are not the same as CO emissions. Without a direct entry for CO emissions in the table, we cannot determine the air emissions of CO for the year 2021 from the given information.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes the unit of measure as tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) for Carbon emissions - Scope 1 for the years 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

However, the table does not provide a specific breakdown of the types of pollutants emitted under Carbon emissions - Scope 1. It only gives a general figure for carbon emissions in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Without a specific value for CO emissions in the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact amount of CO emissions from this table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) CO in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the data provided in the table is for "Carbon emissions - Scope 1" in general and does not specify the breakdown of individual pollutants like CO. Without a specific value for CO emissions in the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact amount of CO emissions for that year from the given table.

Answer:

2024-03-13 22:15:52.355 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag:_filter_document:299 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, there is no specific information related to SOx emissions. The table only includes data on carbon emissions, specifically related to petrol and LPG usage in contractor equipment.

Since the question specifically asks for the air emissions of SOx in the year 2021, and the table does not contain any data related to SOx emissions, we cannot directly find the information on SOx emissions for the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Air emissions of the following pollutants: (3) SOx in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Since the table does not contain any data on SOx emissions or any other pollutants besides carbon emissions, it is not possible to directly find the air emissions of SOx in the year 2021 from the given table.

However, the table only includes information on carbon emissions, specifically related to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and does not mention SOx emissions.

Since the table does not provide any data on SOx emissions or any specific information related to sulfur oxides, we cannot directly retrieve the air emissions of SOx in the year 2021 from the context.
