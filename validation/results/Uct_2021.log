However, the table only includes information on "Termination benefits" and "Total compensation paid to key management personnel."

The "Termination benefits" represent payments made upon the termination of employment, which may not necessarily reflect regular employee wages and benefits. On the other hand, "Total compensation paid to key management personnel" specifically refers to the compensation of key management personnel, which does not encompass all employee wages and benefits.

Since there is no specific indicator in the table that directly represents "Employee wages and benefits" in general for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Employee wages and benefits in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

The table only mentions "On-site Fugitive emissions" with an explanation about intentional or unintentional release of GHGs not included under the Kyoto Protocol. There is no mention of GHG Scope 3 emissions or any data related to emissions for the year 2021.

Since there is no direct mention or data provided regarding GHG Scope 3 emissions for the year 2021 in the table, the answer to the question "What was the GHG Scope 3 emissions in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Since there is no specific mention of "Other Income" in the table, we cannot directly retrieve the information about the "Other Income" as per the income statement in the year 2021 from the context provided.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:17:20.660 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Let's analyze the second table first:

| Revenue                              | 183547                                      | 1733                            | 160131                                      | 5239                            |

In this table, the revenue for the year 2021 is explicitly given as 183547.0 for UCT Medical Centre (Pty) Ltd. Therefore, the Revenue in the year 2021 is indeed 183547.0.

Now, let's move on to the first table:

|                                             |   2021 R'000 |   2020 R'000 |

| Total revenue from contracts with customers |      2775542 |      2024664 |

In this table, the Revenue for the year 2021 is not explicitly given. However, the Revenue from Rendering of services in 2021 is provided as 696769. Since the question is specifically about Revenue, we cannot directly conclude the Revenue for 2021 from this table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the
unit is already in the required unit, do not convert it.
For example, 'What is 242353 Rands in rand? Answer: 242353' is the correct answer.

The table includes information on "Tonnes of CO2e" for the years 2020 and 2021, as well as the percentage of total emissions for those years.

The table provides data on "Tonnes of CO2e" for 2021 under the columns "Tonnes of CO2e - 2021." However, to calculate GHG Intensity, we also need revenue data to relate emissions to revenue. Unfortunately, the table does not include any information on revenue or any other financial metric that would allow us to calculate GHG Intensity.

However, the table only includes information on "Income tax expense" and "Profit/(loss) for the year."

Administration expenses are typically a separate line item in an income statement and are not directly provided in the table. Without a specific mention of administration expenses, we cannot determine the exact amount of ALL Administration expenses for the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the ALL Administration expenses per income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 19:20:11.200 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific entry related to fines or settlements in the provided markdown table. The table includes entries for "Payments" and "Terminations," but neither of these entries explicitly mentions fines or settlements.

The "Payments" entry shows a negative value for 2021, indicating payments made, but it does not specify whether these payments are related to fines or settlements. Similarly, the "Terminations" entry does not provide information directly related to fines or settlements in 2021.

Without a specific entry indicating fines paid or payable due to settlements in 2021, we cannot determine the exact amount from the provided table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes information on CO2 emissions and percentages related to Scope 3 categories such as Purchased Goods & Services and Waste Generated in Operations.

There is no specific mention of food waste or recycling in the table. The indicators provided are focused on CO2 emissions and percentages related to different scopes of activities, not on the volume of waste sent for recycling, specifically food waste recovered.

Without any data related to food waste recycling or recovery in the table, we cannot determine the volume of waste sent for recycling (tonnes) specifically for food waste recovered in the year 2021.

The attendance rates for the Audit committee meetings in the year 2021 are explicitly provided for both Mr H Maritz and Dr R Morar. Both individuals have a 100% attendance rate for all the meetings in 2021. Therefore, the overall Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021 is indeed 100%.

For the second table:

However, the table only includes information about the amounts spent on the Avenue Road building and the Teacher Education building, without any specific mention of BBBEE procurement spend or total spend.

Since there is no explicit mention of BBBEE procurement spend or total spend in the table, we cannot directly determine the percentage of BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021 from the given context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from all EME's as a % of total spend in the year 2021? Do not include the word 'Level' in the answer." is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table only includes details such as the names of the members, their designation, and their attendance status in various months along with a percentage.

Since there is no direct mention of the age of the Board members in the table, we cannot determine which members were over 50 years old in the year 2021 based on the given information.

However, the table only includes information on depreciation and zero book value adjustment for various asset categories.

The depreciation and zero book value adjustment figures do not directly provide the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021. These figures are related to the accounting treatment of assets over their useful lives and adjustments made to the book value of assets, not the initial acquisition costs.

Without a specific line item indicating the cost relating to acquisition per income statement for the year 2021, we cannot directly retrieve this information from the context provided in the table.

The table specifically outlines engagements related to performing agreed-upon procedures over staff salaries and subsidy claims for research outputs.

The purpose of the engagements mentioned in the table does not align with the specific topic of discussion related to human rights, indigenous rights, and operations in conflict areas. Without any indication of discussions or due diligence practices related to these specific areas, we cannot directly find the information regarding the discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, and operations in areas of conflict in the year 2021 from the provided table.

However, the table only includes information about the purpose of engagements and the period covered for two entities, the National Research Foundation and the Joint Medical Scheme.

The purpose of engagement for the National Research Foundation is related to expenditure selection and utilization, while for the Joint Medical Scheme, it is about performing agreed-upon procedures over staff salaries claimable from the Provincial Government of the Western Cape. There is no explicit mention of discussions regarding engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights, or operations in conflict areas.
