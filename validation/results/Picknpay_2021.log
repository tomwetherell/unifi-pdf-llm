In the provided markdown table, there is a mention of "R53.4 billion spent with B-BBEE businesses during the last financial year including 10 new SMME vendors." This statement provides information about the total amount spent with B-BBEE businesses during the last financial year, but it does not break down the spend by specific categories such as Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), or Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned.

Since the table does not provide a breakdown of the BBBEE procurement spend from the specified categories for the year 2021, the answer to the question is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:14:12.687 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this type of spend in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Spend on Black-owned Businesses in Rand billion" and "Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion."

While the table provides information on the spend on black-owned businesses and black women-owned businesses in Rand billion, it does not specifically break down the spend based on the categories of Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs), and Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned. Without a specific breakdown of the spend based on these categories, we cannot determine the exact BBBEE procurement spend from these specific groups in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the BBBEE procurement spend from Exempt Micro Enterprises (EMEs), Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs) & Empowering Suppliers that are >51% black-owned in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:14:32.117 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this rate in the provided markdown table. The table includes the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and the total number of recordable injuries, including fatalities.

The Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) is typically calculated as the number of fatal injuries per million hours worked. However, the table does not provide the total hours worked or any specific indicator that directly gives the FIFR for the year 2021.

While the table includes the Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including fatalities, it does not provide the breakdown of fatal injuries separately. Without the specific number of fatal injuries or the total hours worked, we cannot calculate or directly retrieve the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for the year 2021 from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes information on GHG emissions intensity for Scope 2 emissions expressed as Metric tonnes of CO2e per unit of Million Rands for different financial years.

However, the table does not provide the direct GHG Scope 2 emissions value for the year 2021. It only presents the GHG emissions intensity for Scope 2 emissions, which is a different metric compared to the total GHG emissions in Scope 2. The intensity metric indicates the amount of emissions per unit of financial output, not the total emissions.

Since the table does not contain the exact GHG Scope 2 emissions value for the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the GHG Scope 2 emissions in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The LTIFR is typically calculated as the number of lost time injuries per 1 million hours worked.

In the provided markdown table, we have the number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for the years FY23, FY22, FY21, and FY20. However, we do not have the total number of hours worked in each of these years, which is necessary to calculate the LTIFR.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:15:26.037 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) is listed as 102. However, it is important to note that the value for the year 2021 is not explicitly provided in the second table, so we cannot confirm if it is indeed 102 for that year. 

In the third table, the value for MTCs in 2021 is again listed as 102. Therefore, based on the information provided in the tables, we can conclude that the Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) in the year 2021 is 102.

The indicator "190 Total Number of Environmental Incidents (Level 1, 2 and/or 3)" provides the total number of environmental incidents, but it does not specify whether these incidents had a negative impact. Without further details on the severity or impact of these incidents, we cannot determine the number of environmental incidents with a negative impact in the year 2021 from the given table.

The table includes indicators such as "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" and "Total Number of Environmental Complaints."

While these indicators provide information on fines, non-compliances, and complaints related to the environment, they do not explicitly mention incidents with a negative impact. The terms "fines," "non-compliances," and "complaints" do not necessarily equate to incidents with a negative impact. Without a specific indicator that directly addresses environmental incidents with a negative impact, we cannot determine the exact number of such incidents in the year 2021 from the table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:15:52.558 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to fatalities in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities" and "Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR)."

The "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities" indicator provides the total number of recordable injuries, which includes fatalities. However, this indicator does not break down the total number into specific categories like fatalities alone. It gives a combined count of various types of injuries.

The "Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR)" indicator provides a rate of fatalities per 200,000 person hours worked but does not give the actual number of fatalities.

Since the table does not explicitly state the specific number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Number of work-related fatalities in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR)" and "Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR)."

The "Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR)" provides the number of LTIs per 200,000 person hours worked, but it does not directly give the total number of lost time injuries for employees in the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:16:22.433 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of occupational injuries in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The indicators in the table include "Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs)" and "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities."

The "Number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs)" specifically mentions injuries on duty leading to at least one lost day. However, this indicator does not provide the total number of occupational injuries, as it focuses only on a subset of injuries that result in lost time.

The "Total Number of Recordable Injuries" includes various types of injuries, such as MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities. While this indicator gives a broader view of injuries, it does not break down the specific number of occupational injuries for the year 2021.

The table includes indicators such as "Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities" and "Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR)."

The indicator "100 Total Number of Recordable Injuries, including MTCs, LTIs, and fatalities" provides the total number of recordable injuries, which includes various types of injuries. However, it does not specifically break down the number of occupational injuries for the year 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:16:30.600 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of occupational injuries in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The indicators in the table include "Number of Fatalities" and "Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs)."

The "Number of Fatalities" indicator specifically mentions injuries on duty leading to death, excluding deaths not occurring 'at work.' This indicator does not provide information on non-fatal injuries, which are typically included in the total number of occupational injuries.

The "Number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs)" indicator includes injuries on duty leading to medical treatment but no lost days. While this indicator gives insight into injuries requiring medical treatment, it does not cover all occupational injuries, including those that may have resulted in lost workdays.

Since the table does not contain a specific indicator for the total number of occupational injuries, including both fatal and non-fatal cases, the exact number of occupational injuries in the year 2021 cannot be directly retrieved from the context.

2024-03-10 18:16:45.109 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the percentage of renewable energy in the year 2021 from the provided markdown table, we need to identify the data related to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or other renewable sources. The table includes information on the total volume of electricity purchased and self-generated, but it does not explicitly specify the breakdown between renewable and non-renewable sources.

Without a specific indicator or data point that directly states the percentage of renewable energy in the year 2021, we cannot directly retrieve this information from the context provided in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage Renewable Energy in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators such as "Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion" and "Spend on Black-owned SMMEs in Rand billion."

The indicator "Spend on Black Women-owned Businesses in Rand billion" provides information on the spending specifically on black women-owned businesses. However, it does not differentiate between majority black-owned suppliers and those that are 30% or more black women-owned. Similarly, the indicator "Spend on Black-owned SMMEs in Rand billion" does not specify the breakdown between majority black-owned and 30% or more black women-owned suppliers.

Without a specific breakdown of the spending between majority black-owned and 30% or more black women-owned suppliers, we cannot determine the exact procurement from these specific categories in the year 2021.

However, the table only includes information about the Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Small Business Development Projects and whether the report includes a discussion of returns on CSI.

The indicator provided in the table focuses on the Rand Million Value of CSI/SED Spend on Small Business Development Projects specifically and does not encompass all the categories mentioned in the question. There is no direct mention of the consolidated CSI Spend covering infrastructure, housing, sanitation, energy, telecoms, and other community-related needs.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Spend on ALL infrastructure and services investment, development, support of housing, sanitation, energy, telecoms and other community-related needs (consolidated CSI Spend) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Conclusion: no

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:17:32.774 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to renewable fuels consumption in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes indicators related to the total volume of electricity purchased and self-generated, excluding specific mention of renewable fuels.

The indicators in the table focus on the volume of electricity purchased and self-generated, but they do not explicitly mention renewable fuels consumption. Without a direct indicator specifying the total energy from renewable fuels consumed, we cannot determine the exact amount of energy from renewable sources consumed in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total energy from renewable fuels consumed in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

The table includes indicators such as "Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked" and "Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules."

The indicator "Total Indirect Energy Consumption (i.e., Electricity) in Gigajoules" provides data in gigajoules, not in megawatt hours. To convert gigajoules to megawatt hours, a conversion calculation would be required. Additionally, the indicator specifically mentions gigajoules, which may not directly translate to megawatt hours without additional information or conversion factors.

Since the table does not explicitly provide the total megawatt hours of electricity consumed in 2021 and the data is in gigajoules, the answer to the question "What was the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

However, the table only includes indicators related to the percentage of electricity consumed that was self-generated and the average electricity consumed per person hour worked.

There is no specific indicator in the table that directly provides the total megawatt hours of electricity consumed in the year 2021. The indicators provided do not give a direct measure of the total electricity consumption in megawatt hours for that specific year.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Total megawatt hours electricity consumed in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:18:17.642 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this type of audit in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Number of Food Safety Product Tests" and "Number of Food Safety Store Audits."

The indicator "Number of Food Safety Store Audits" directly relates to audits conducted in stores specifically for food safety. However, it does not explicitly mention "Store Operational Health and Safety Audits." While food safety audits may encompass some aspects of health and safety, they may not cover the full scope of operational health and safety audits in a store.

Without a specific indicator for Store Operational Health and Safety Audits or clear information indicating that the Food Safety Store Audits also cover operational health and safety aspects comprehensively, we cannot determine the exact number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits in the year 2021 from the provided table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Number of Store Operational Health and Safety Audits in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The TRIFR and TRIIR are related but not the same. The TRIFR typically refers to the number of recordable injuries per million hours worked, while the TRIIR is a broader measure that includes the severity of injuries and their impact on the workforce.

However, the indicator does not explicitly state that it excludes infrastructure investments.

Since the question specifically asks for the total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excluding infrastructure investments, and the table does not provide a breakdown separating infrastructure investments from other types of spending, we cannot definitively determine the exact total spend on community health & social welfare initiatives excluding infrastructure investments in the year 2021 from the given table.

The table includes information on the number of Board Members who are deemed Executive and the number of Board Members who are deemed Independent for different fiscal years.

However, the table does not explicitly provide the total number of Board Members for each fiscal year, including 2021. The indicators mentioned in the table only specify the breakdown of Board Members based on their roles (Executive or Independent) but do not give a direct count of the total number of Board Members.

Without a specific indicator that directly states the total number of Board Members for the year 2021, we cannot determine the exact number of Board Members in that specific year from the given table.

The indicator "Number of Board Members" provides the total number of board members, which includes both executive and non-executive members. However, it does not explicitly state the number of executive board members separately for the year 2021.

The table includes the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive for different fiscal years, but it does not provide the exact number of non-executive board members.

The information given in the table only shows the percentage of board members who are deemed non-executive for each fiscal year, not the actual count of non-executive board members. Without the specific number of total board members for each year, we cannot calculate the exact number of non-executive board members.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:19:30.300 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To determine the number of non-executive board members in the year 2021 from the provided markdown table, we need to focus on the relevant indicator. In this case, the table includes information on the "Number of Board Members who are deemed 'Independent'" for different fiscal years, including FY21.

The row corresponding to FY21 states that there were 7 board members who were deemed 'Independent' in that year. However, this row specifically mentions the number of board members who are independent, not specifically the number of non-executive board members.

While independent board members are often non-executive, it is not explicitly stated in the table that all independent board members are non-executive. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the number of independent board members in FY21 equates to the number of non-executive board members in that year.

As a result, the answer to the question "What was the Number of non-executive board members in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The indicator "Average Length of Director (full Board) Service (in years)" provides the average number of years of service for directors on the full board. Specifically, the value for the year 2021 is 11.3 years. This value represents the average number of years of service for directors on the full board in 2021, which directly answers the question about the number of years on the Board per Board Member in 2021.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:19:44.942 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Percentage of Board Members who are Women" and "Average Length of Executive Director Service (in years)."

The indicator "Average Length of Executive Director Service (in years)" provides information on the average length of service for executive directors, not specifically for board members in general. This indicator does not directly give us the number of years on the Board per Board Member in 2021.

Since there is no specific indicator in the table that directly provides the number of years on the Board per Board Member in 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Number of years on the Board per Board Member in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:20:05.084 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this type of information in the provided markdown table. The table includes information on the "Rand value of losses resulting from legal proceedings (including fines) due to fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anti-competitive behavior, market manipulation, malpractice or violations of other industry laws or regulations." However, this indicator does not specifically mention fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations.

Since the table does not provide a specific breakdown of fines and sanctions related to non-compliance with environmental regulations, we cannot determine the exact amount of fines and sanctions for this particular category in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '0.0' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:20:10.244 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table for the year 2021, the row related to fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations is as follows:

| 191 Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2-27b | | G4.2 | |

Based on this row, the value provided for the year 2021 is '0', indicating that there were no environmental fines and/or non-compliances reported for that year.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021?" based on the first table is '0'.

Now, looking at the second table for the year 2021, the row related to fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations is as follows:

| 191 Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2-27b | | G4.2 | |

Similar to the first table, the value provided for the year 2021 in the second table is also '0', indicating no environmental fines and/or non-compliances reported for that year.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question "What was the Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental regulations in the year 2021?" based on the second table is also '0'.

2024-03-10 18:20:28.752 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Carbon Intensity, which is the Average Volume of Carbon Emissions per Person Hour Worked (tonnes CO2 e/PHW) in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this metric in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators related to energy consumption and energy efficiency per person hour worked, but it does not provide a direct indicator for carbon emissions per person hour worked.

The indicators provided in the table are related to energy consumption in gigajoules and energy efficiency in megajoules per person hour worked. While energy consumption is related to carbon emissions, the direct measurement of carbon emissions per person hour worked is not explicitly stated in the table.

Without a specific indicator for carbon emissions per person hour worked, we cannot determine the exact Carbon Intensity for the year 2021 from the information provided in the table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:20:43.300 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021, we need to look for the specific indicator related to this metric in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Total Direct and Indirect (i.e., Electricity) Energy Consumption in Gigajoules" and "Total Energy Efficiency: Total Direct Energy & Indirect Energy Consumed per Person Hour Worked [MJ/PHW]."

The indicator "Total Energy Efficiency: Total Direct Energy & Indirect Energy Consumed per Person Hour Worked [MJ/PHW]" provides information on energy consumption per person hour worked in megajoules (MJ). To convert this to kilowatt-hours (kWh), further calculations would be required as 1 MJ is equal to 0.277778 kWh.

Since the table does not directly provide the metric in kWh/PHW for electricity efficiency in the year 2021, the answer to the question "What was the Electricity Efficiency: Average Electricity Consumed per Person Hour Worked (kWh/PHW) in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Are you sure that '66.7' is the correct answer to the question: "What was the Percentage of non-executive board members in the year 2021? "?

Please consider each table individually. Only pay attention to the row corresponding to the
year in questin. Be careful not to incorrectly state that the value is provided for the other years, but not for the year in question (unless this is the case).
It is possible that the answer is not explicitly stated in the context.

Think step by step. Please conclude your answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:20:57.403 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:validate_response:385 - Validation response: Looking at the first table, for the year 2021, the Percentage of Board Members who are deemed Non-Executive is 66.7%. This does not directly answer the question about the Percentage of non-executive board members in the year 2021. 

In the second table, for the year 2021, the Percentage of Board Members who are deemed Non-Executive is 66.7%. This does not directly answer the question about the Percentage of non-executive board members in the year 2021.

In the third table, for the year 2021, the Percentage of Non-Executive Board Members who are deemed 'Independent' is not explicitly provided. 

Therefore, based on the information available in the tables, we cannot definitively determine the Percentage of non-executive board members in the year 2021.

2024-03-10 18:21:00.952 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021, we need to look at the specific row in the provided markdown table that corresponds to the year 2021. In this case, row 28 provides the number of board members deemed 'Independent' for each fiscal year, including FY21.

The table directly provides the number of independent board members for FY21 as 7. However, to calculate the percentage of independent board members, we need to know the total number of board members in FY21. Unfortunately, the total number of board members is not explicitly given in the table. Without this information, we cannot calculate the percentage of independent board members for the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage of independent board members in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:21:03.842 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to board composition or independence in the provided markdown table. The table includes indicators such as "Independence of Board Chairman" and "Does the company have a publicly available policy on Board Conflicts of Interest & Politically Exposed Persons," but these indicators do not directly provide information on the percentage of independent board members.

Without a specific indicator that directly states the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021, we cannot determine this information from the context provided in the table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Percentage of independent board members in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

2024-03-10 18:21:07.669 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021, we need to look at the specific data related to the number of board members deemed 'Independent' for that year in the provided markdown table. In this case, the table includes a row that indicates the "Number of Board Members who are deemed 'Independent'" for each fiscal year, including FY21.

By looking at the data for FY21, we see that there were 7 board members deemed 'Independent' in that year. To calculate the percentage of independent board members for FY21, we would need to know the total number of board members for that year. However, the total number of board members is not explicitly provided in the table.

Since the total number of board members is required to calculate the percentage of independent board members, and this information is not directly available in the context, we cannot determine the percentage of independent board members in the year 2021 from the given table.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:21:17.286 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to advisory fees in the provided markdown table. However, the table only includes information about the financial auditor and auditor remuneration as a percentage of non-audit fees.

There is no direct mention of advisory fees in the table. The indicators provided are related to the financial auditor and their remuneration, not specific advisory fees. Without a specific line item or indicator for advisory fees in the table, we cannot determine the exact amount of advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Advisory fees as per the income statement in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

The table includes indicators such as Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR), but these are not the same as the All Injury Frequency Rate.

The LTIFR and TRIFR provided in the table are specific metrics that measure the frequency of lost time injuries and total recordable injuries, respectively, per a certain number of person hours worked.

However, the provided markdown table only includes the number of Medical Treatment Cases (MTCs) and Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for each fiscal year, without specifying the total hours worked.

Since the table does not provide the total number of hours worked in the year 2021, we cannot directly calculate the All Injury Frequency Rate for that specific year. The All Injury Frequency Rate requires both the number of injuries and the number of hours worked to be calculated accurately.

The table includes indicators such as "Total Number of Environmental Incidents" and "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances."

The indicator "Total Number of Environmental Fines and/or Non-Compliances" provides information on the number of fines or non-compliances but does not directly give the amount of fines paid or payable. It only indicates the count of such incidents.

Without a specific breakdown of the monetary value associated with the fines or non-compliances, we cannot determine the exact amount of fines paid or payable due to settlements in the year 2021 from the given table.

You are aware of how to convert between different units within the same system of measurement.
For example, 1236 million = 1236 * 1 million = 1236 * 1000000 = 1236000000.
For example, to convert from Rm to R, you would multiply by 1000000. This is because 1 Rm = 1000000 R.
Do not do any unit conversion if it is not necessary. That is, if the

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:24:33.718 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, there is a row labeled "197 CDP Forest (Palm Oil/Soya/Beef/Timber)" which seems to be related to forestland. However, the values in the table under this row are not specific area measurements but rather a combination of letters (e.g., D/C/C/C, C/D/C) which do not directly represent the area of forestland owned.

The table does not provide a specific numerical value or unit that indicates the area of forestland owned in the year 2021. Without a clear and direct measurement of the forestland area in the table, we cannot determine the exact area of forestland owned in the year 2021 from the given context.

The data entries are in the format of letters (e.g., C, D) which likely represent certain categories or ratings related to forest management practices for palm oil, soya, beef, and timber.

However, the specific question asks for the area of forestland restored and/or rehabilitated in the year 2021. The table does not provide explicit numerical data or a clear indicator related to the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated in any of the fiscal years mentioned.

The entry for FY21 under the CDP Forest (Palm Oil/Soya/Beef/Timber) indicator is "C/D/C," which does not directly provide information on the area of forestland restored and/or rehabilitated in that year. The codes "C" and "D" likely represent different levels or grades, but they do not explicitly quantify the area of forestland restored or rehabilitated.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:24:55.290 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: To find the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021, we need to look for a specific indicator related to this information in the provided markdown table. The table includes an indicator labeled "Overall Board and Committee Meeting attendance" with attendance rates for different fiscal years, including FY21.

The attendance rate for the Audit committee meetings is not explicitly mentioned in the table. The indicator provided refers to the overall board and committee meeting attendance, which may or may not include specific details about the Audit committee.

Without a specific breakdown of attendance rates for the Audit committee meetings separately, we cannot determine the attendance rate for the Audit committee specifically in the year 2021 from the given table.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Audit committee meeting attendance rate in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the average number of hours of training on anti-corruption issues per employee in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.

Answer:

2024-03-10 18:27:59.402 | DEBUG    | esg_retriever.rag.rag:filter_context_documents:325 - Filtering context response: In the provided markdown table, the content seems to focus on recommended disclosures and references related to risk management, specifically around climate-related risks and opportunities. While the table mentions how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, it does not explicitly provide the description of the approach to the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021.

The table content is more centered on governance around climate-related risks and opportunities rather than a detailed description of the approach to ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes. It does not directly address the specific question about the organization's approach to incorporating ESG factors in investment and wealth management in 2021.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What was the Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies in the year 2021?" is not directly retrievable from the context.
